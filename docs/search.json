Ordering them by perceived commitment seems like it can only serve to nudge them in untoward ways to be more or less likely to select some.\n\n\nAlso I don’t think we have good grounds to predict what the order of increasing commitment is or to assume this is invariant across respondents.\n\n\nDR: OK, I see your point, if we actually want to know, and see these as measures of how many people will do/think each of these things.

    "text": "8.1 Discussion and framework\n\n8.1.1 Introduction and goals\nThe purpose of this document is to propose the fundamentals for a workflow for power analyses. I will begin with a standard frequentist analysis.2\nThe general approach laid out here can be the basis for developing and build a library of common analyses and inference goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful future additions to the toolkit would include\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclear and flexible ways to generate hypothetical data sets, and\nadding further analytic designs.\n\nDR: I think tools like DeclareDesign can help with this.\n\n\n\nThis is not intended as an exhaustive introduction to the fundamentals of statistical power–I assume you are reasonably well-versed in some general principles of statistical inference and hypothesis testing, as well as in the basic idea of what power analysis is.3\nWe will focus solely on ‘simulation-based’ power analysis,4 and not on ways of mathematically (analytically) deriving power.\n\n8.1.2 Definition of power\nIn frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), power is typically defined as ‘the probability that we can reject the null hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis is indeed true’ (i.e., power is the ‘true positive rate’). More precisely, we may express this as ‘power against a particular alternative hypothesis’.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom wikipedia: The statistical power of a binary hypothesis test…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statistical power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when a specific alternative hypothesis \\(H_{1}\\) is true. It is commonly denoted by \\(1-\\beta\\), and represents the chances of a “true positive” detection conditional on the actual existence of an effect to detect. … as the power of a test increases, the probability \\(\\beta\\) of making a type II error by wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis decreases.\nlink accessed 12 Apr 2022\n\n\n\nNote that some Bayesian statisticians question the validity and usefulness of this presentation of power analysis.6\nBefore we conduct an experiment (or run a survey, or collect data for an analysis), there are many hypothetical future data sets we might observe. Whether we favor a frequentist or Bayesian approach, it seems reasonable to ask: ‘Given the range of data that I might observe, how likely is it that I can make certain conclusions?’. 7\nWe can broaden the idea of power to indicate the probability that our proposed sample yields information that allows us to make some specific kind of inference about the data-generating process. Given a particular underlying effect (or range of effects, or lack thereof), and a particular sample size (or range of sample sizes), we may ask ‘what is the probability of’… ?:8\n\n‘determining’ that there is a non-zero difference between two conditions,9\n\ndetecting some ‘smallest effect size of interest’,\na ‘false positive’,10\n\nachieving a desired level of precision around a particular parameter estimate, or\nfinding an effect ‘likely equivalent to zero’ or ‘unlikely to be far from zero’.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Power of an equivalence test’ (key aside)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may wish to estimate the ‘likelihood that we will determine that the effect is in a near-zero range’, when the true effect size are in fact zero or very small. The former determination is called an ‘equivalence test’; thus we may want to compute the ‘power of an equivalence test against a particular distribution of true (small) effect sizes’. I’ll call the latter the ‘equivalence distribution’ for now.\n\nDetermine how we wish to compute our equivalence test (there may be dragons here)\nSimulate a large number of data sets arising under the equivalence distribution\nCompute the equivalence test for each simulated data set.\nCount the share of these that ‘determine the effect is near zero’. This share is the ‘power of our equivalence test against the equivalence distribution’\n\n\n\n\nHence, a power analysis helps frame our prospective research project in relation to the goals we would like to achieve.12 It provides uswith an estimate (and it is indeed an estimate, not a certainty!) of the probability that we will be able to make the inference we wish to make, given various factors both inside and outside of our control. (See discussion in fold.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is ‘in our control’?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might think of sample size as in our control, which it generally is, but this is typically limited by practical considerations outside of our control (such as the availability of a sample or financial constraints). Conversely, effect size is often considered out of our control ; however we can sometimes increase the ‘dosage’ we give, or try to select a particular group of participants who might be particularly susceptible to our effect of interest.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 General workflow for simulation-based power analysis\nSimulation-based power analysis proceeds in four primary steps:\n\n\nGenerate a large number of ‘simulated data sets’ for the analysis.13\n\n\nWe generate data sets generated to be specific to the study’s goal. E.g., suppose we want to know the ‘power to detect an effect size of 0.2 SD’.14 Here, for considering the true positive and false negative rates, we should generate data that reflects this effect size. If we also want to measure the rate of type-2 error15 we should also generate data reflecting a ‘null effect’.\n\nRun the proposed analysis over the many simulated data sets. (Do this as efficiently as possible, as it can take a long time.) This analysis should either return the estimand of interest, or ensure that we can easily compute it (in Step 3). The output should be kept as flexible as possible (while conserving computer memory). This will allow us to assess multiple inference goals on the same output.16\nSummarize the output returned in Step 2. Compute the share of simulated data sets that meet particular inference goals or decision criteria. (Example described in fold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: a simple case of simulating data to measure power\n\n\n\n\n\nE.g., we might simulate 1000 data sets based on an effect size of 0.3 standard deviations and perform a standard t-test of the difference between treatment and control for each of these. We might then find that for 743 of 1000 of these simulated data, the test ‘rejected the null hypothesis’, suggesting a power of 74.3%.\n\n\n\n\nThis can show the likelihood of achieving a range of goals (under various sample sizes and design and testing choices) including the rates of misleading conclusions. In frequentist analyses, steps 2 and 3 can often be done together (e.g., the p-value is returned along with the other output). In my experience with typical Bayesian designs, these stages are best kept separate so that we can first do the more time-consuming Step 2, and then more freely explore the various options in Step 3.\n\n\nAssess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results. If not, consider alternative design or data-collection choices (including sample sizes, treatments, and treatment assignments) or inference goals, and return to Step 1.17\n\n\nIn the following sections, we present some generally useful packages and functions for power analyses. We give annotated code examples, highlighting useful aspects. We do this in the context of a frequentist power analysis for between-groups analysis.18\n19\n\n8.1.4 Possible pitfalls/misunderstandings of power analysis\nPower analyses are a useful tool for considering the basic plausibility of achieving certain goals. But they are not an ‘omniscient oracle’, and may be somewhat of a blunt instrument. They might better be termed ‘power projections’ or ‘power estimates’. Even if we estimate that we have 99.9% power for detecting some a particular effect, we may have specified our simulations in an unrealistic way. When we actually run an experiment, we might see (e.g.) far more underlying variation or measurement error than we predicted, leading our analyses to be fairly uninformative. Conversely, we might be overly conservative with our power analysis; perhaps a design we thought was ‘underpowered’ actually has a high probability of producing very compelling results.\nConsidering: when can power analyses be helpful? and when can they be limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntricate data exploration versus broad inference\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we see real data and real interesting patterns emerge, we are likely to go further in modeling and investigating these patterns than some of the more simple analyses and comparisons we conduct in the initial power analysis. I suspect power analyses are not so good for determining all the intricate, in-depth things we might plumb in a dataset. They are probably better at assessing the tractability of a broad inference goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex models, forking paths, and tractibility\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might want to give some consideration to how far we wish to go in the initial data simulation step to think about all sorts of hypothetical data sets. As models become more complex, the number of different parameters that might vary - with possible effects on power - starts to balloon. E.g., even in a simple repeated-measures example, do we wish to vary not only the effect size but all sorts of different correlations from pre- to post-treatment within subjects? If we are simulating ordinal data, then power might change depending on how we initially suggest binning the outcomes, but there are infinitely many ways we might think the data might look… Discussion and consideration of how far we should go with these things is welcome and could be useful! (DR: I’m not sure what you are getting at here. Are you saying that ‘the space of designs and proposed analyses we can explore is extremely large, and we may need to make some ad-hoc choices to avoid this getting unmanageable’?)"

In this case, we will be comparing four groups, each shown a different message in a between-subjects design (three active groups vs. a control condition with a neutral message).\nIn this example, the ‘different groups’ in our design play a second role in helping us assess our power against several different possible effect sizes.21 \n\nCode# tidyverse simply used for data wrangling and plotting\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nCode: The four.group.datamaker function creates a tibble (data frame) of\n\na (std) normally distributed outcome\nan ordinal categorization of this outcome\nwith four groups, each with (potentially) different outcome means\nwith ppg rows per group\nwith defaults as described\n\n\nCodefour.group.datamaker <- function(sim = 1, a = 0, b = .1, c = .2, d = .4, ppg=1500) {\n\n#DR I renamed it `ppg` for 'population per group' because `pop` confused me\n\n  # first a tibble (data frame) with 1500 ppts, with the different groups showing\n  # effect sizes in Cohen's d of .1, .2, and .4\n  four.groups <- tibble(a.control = rnorm(ppg, a, 1),\n                        b.small = rnorm(ppg, b, 1),\n                        c.medsmall = rnorm(ppg, c, 1),\n                        d.medium = rnorm(ppg, d, 1),\n                        counter = 1:ppg) %>% #we previously called the counter 'sample.size' because of its later use\n\n    # turn the data into long form\n    pivot_longer(cols = 'a.control':'d.medium', names_to = 'group', values_to = 'response') %>%\n\n    # put cutpoints in the data to make it more similar to the ordinal responses we would get\n    mutate(ordinal = case_when(response < -1.5 ~ 1,\n                               response < -.5 ~ 2,\n                               response < .5 ~ 3,\n                               response < 1.5 ~ 4,\n                               response >= 1.5 ~ 5),\n\n           # for the purposes of this demo we will not analyse it as ordinal as it takes longer\n           # to run the regressions, but if you did so you would also want to make the response\n           # a factor\n           ordinal = as.factor(ordinal),\n           sim = sim)\n\n  return(four.groups)\n\n }\n\n\nWe plot the data generated in one instance, to check our code and setup:\n\nCode# test that the function works to make one data set before making many!\ntest.data <- four.group.datamaker()\n\nggplot(data = test.data) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = response, fill = group), alpha = .3) +\n  theme(\n    aspect.ratio = .5\n  ) +\n  ggtitle('Test four groups, continuous outcome')\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(data = test.data) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = as.numeric(ordinal)), alpha = .6,\n                 position = position_dodge(), bins = 10) +\n  facet_wrap(~group, nrow=1) +\n  theme(\n    aspect.ratio = 1\n  ) +\n  ggtitle('Test four groups, categorical outcome')\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the plots that the function appears to be working. When developing a data set for the first time, one would usually go further with some ‘diagnostic’ checks to confirm that the data is behaving as you intended.22\nEfficiently generate many data sets\nNow we just need to run the function above many times over. This could be done using loops, but a very useful set of R functions in the tidyverse is the purrr package of map functions. Even better, a package called furrr is available to run such map functions in parallel to further reduce time.23 For furrr to do this, we need to tell it to plan for ‘multisession’, and give it a seed in the code below. 24\n\nCodep_load(furrr)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\nplan(multisession)\noptions <- furrr_options(seed = 48238)\n\n\nCode: We map over all 500 elements of the vector nsims to create 500 simulated data sets.25\n\nCode# we will pass N = 500 simulations to the map function\nnsims <- 1:500\n\n# the map function will run our data-making function over nsims=500 simulations\nsim.data <- furrr::future_map_dfr(\n  .x = nsims,\n  .f = four.group.datamaker,\n  a = 0,\n  b = .1,\n  c = .2,\n  d = .4,\n  .options = options\n)\n\n# split the simulated data into the separate simulations\n\nsim.data <- sim.data %>% group_by(sim) %>% group_split()\n\n\nNow, we have 500 simulated data sets representing our hypothetical outcome data, and can perform analyses on them. Here’s a peek at part of one of these data sets, the third simulation:\n\nCodehead(sim.data[[3]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounter\ngroup\nresponse\nordinal\nsim\n\n\n1\na.control\n-0.395 \n3\n3\n\n\n1\nb.small\n-0.396 \n3\n3\n\n\n1\nc.medsmall\n-0.0762\n3\n3\n\n\n1\nd.medium\n0.994 \n4\n3\n\n\n2\na.control\n-0.931 \n2\n3\n\n\n2\nb.small\n-1.58  \n1\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Step 2: Run the proposed analysis over the many data sets and return the estimands of interest\nBefore we run an analysis over the many simulated data sets, we should to check that our models can run on these, and that they will return the estimands we are looking for. For a Bayesian analysis, this step might involve dropping parts of the posterior that are not relevant26 and ensuring we get the parts we care about (e.g., we might insert additional code to retrieve a posterior distribution for Cohen’s d).27\nFor frequentist analyses, there are also a range of estimands we might care about, depending on our estimation and inference goals. For example, we might consider returning a p-value, or the upper and lower bounds for confidence intervals, or r-squared estimates, etc.\nThe key point: before you drop the large set of simulated data sets and the regression results for each, make sure you every estimated that might be of interest; you don’t want to have to to re-run the entire analysis.\nIn addition, you want to run the analysis on different sample sizes of the data, to generate a power curve plot. I.e., a plot showing how your power increases as you increase the sample size.\nIn the example function below, we run a simple linear regression, predicting the response from group.\n\nCodelinear.reg.maker <- function(data, breaks) { #runs a particular regression over a set of cuts of larger and larger subsets of  multiple data sets\n\n  # this function cuts the data set it is given into different sample sizes\n  cut.samples <- function(break.point, data) {\n    cut.data <- filter(data, counter <= break.point) %>%\n      mutate(sample.size = break.point)\n    return(cut.data)\n  }\n\n  data.cuts <- map_dfr(.x = breaks, .f = cut.samples, data = data)\n\n  # the data is split according to the sample size\n  # to feed to the regression model\n  data.cuts <- data.cuts %>% group_by(sample.size) %>% group_split()\n\n  # this function runs the regression\n  run.reg <- function(data) {\n\n    four.group.form <- as.numeric(ordinal) ~ 1 + group\n\n    four.group.reg <-\n      lm(formula = four.group.form,\n           data = data)\n\n    # we extract confidence intervals for the parameters of interest\n    ci99 <- confint(four.group.reg, level = .99)\n    ci95 <- confint(four.group.reg, level = .95)\n\n    # we create an 'output' to show the confidence intervals around the effects\n    # and some additional inference info, e.g., 'nonzero' indicates whether\n    # the lower bound of the CI excludes 0 or not.\n    # 'width' indicates the width of the confidence interval,\n    # for assessment of precision\n    output <- tibble(group = c('small', 'medsmall', 'medium',\n                               'small', 'medsmall', 'medium'),\n                     interval = c(.99, .99, .99, .95, .95, .95),\n                     lower = c(ci99[[2,1]], ci99[[3,1]], ci99[[4,1]],\n                               ci95[[2,1]], ci95[[3,1]], ci95[[4,1]]),\n                     upper = c(ci99[[2,2]], ci99[[3,2]], ci99[[4,2]],\n                               ci95[[2,2]], ci95[[3,2]], ci95[[4,2]])) %>%\n  #DR: maybe this code should be made a little more flexible?; because if you wanted to consider additional-sized effects you would need to expand the entries above\n\n      mutate('nonzero' = case_when(lower > 0 ~ 1,\n                                   TRUE ~ 0),\n             'width' = abs(upper - lower),\n             'sim' = data[[1, 'sim']],\n             'cell.size' = nrow(data)/4)\n\n    return(output)\n  }\n\n  # run the regression function over the different sample sizes\n  output <- map_df(.x = data.cuts, .f = run.reg)\n\n  return(output)\n}\n\n\n\nOnce we have made and tested that our function works as intended and returns the values we want to make inferences from, we can run it over the many simulated data sets:\n\nCodet1 <- Sys.time()\nlinreg.output <- future_map_dfr(.x = sim.data,\n                                .f = linear.reg.maker,\n                                breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150))\nt2 <- Sys.time()\nt2 - t1\n\nTime difference of 13.41984 secs\n\n\nThe object linreg.output is now a large dataframe, cataloguing whether or not certain inference thresholds were reached across the many simulations. In the third primary step, we can summarise and graphically display this information.\n\n8.2.3 Step 3: Summarise the output returned in Step 2 to determine the likelihood of achieving various inferential goals\nNow, we want to know how likely we are to achieve a range of inferential goals, depending on factors such as the sample size, the underlying effect sizes, or anything else we varied in simulating our data and running our models. For this example, this is as simple as generating a summary of the output from Step 2… 28\n\nCode# group the data according to group, confidence interval, and size per group\nfour.group.lin.summary <- linreg.output %>% group_by(group, interval, cell.size) %>%\n  # summarise the amount of times we get a CI greater than 0\n  summarise(.groups = 'keep',\n            'ci above 0 vs. control' = sum(nonzero)/5)  %>%\n  # change some factors for plotting\n  mutate(interval = factor(interval, levels = c('0.95', '0.99'),\n                           labels = c('95% CI', '99% CI')),\n         'Effect size' = factor(group, levels = c('small', 'medsmall', 'medium'),\n                                labels = c('Very small (.1)', 'Small (.2)', 'Medium (.4)')))\n\n\nA… and then plotting the resulting power curve:\n\nCode(\npower_curve_4_group_lin <- ggplot(data = four.group.lin.summary) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 1550), breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 80), linetype = 'dashed', size = .33, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 90), linetype = 'dashed', size = .33, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_path(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`,\n                group = `Effect size`), size = .66) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`),\n             size = 1.5) +\n  labs(y = 'Power to detect a non-zero effect',\n       x = 'Number of participants per condition (control group not included)') +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#c10d0d', '#7dc3c2', '#dcc55b')) +\n  facet_wrap(~interval) +\n  theme(\n    aspect.ratio = 1,\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\", size = 0.33),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = \"white\", size = 0.2),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey96\"),\n    axis.line = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.375),\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.5),\n    text = element_text(color = 'black', family = 'Gill Sans MT', size = 9),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = 'black', family = 'Gill Sans MT', size = 7),\n    strip.background = element_blank()\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Step 4. Assess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results.\nIn Step 4, we use the information we have generated above to make substantive conclusions about the projected power of our experiment to detect particular effects, given particular underlying parameters. From this we can make recommendations as to experimental design.\nBased on the power curve plotted above, we can conclude that we would have a very high likelihood of detecting effects of .4 versus a control group at even quite low sample sizes, and also a good possibility of detecting effect sizes of .2 at quite modest sample sizes. On the other hand, for the very small effect size, we would not be likely to detect a difference from a control group even with 1500 participants per group. If effect sizes of this sizes are of interest, then we might consider going back to Step 1 and reconsidering our experimental design to include more participants."

    "text": "10.1 Equivalence tests and simple frequentist approaches\nFrom Wikipedia (accessed 12 Apr 2022)\n\nIn equivalence tests, the null hypothesis is defined as an effect large enough to be deemed interesting, specified by an equivalence bound. The alternative hypothesis is any effect that is less extreme than said equivalence bound. The observed data is statistically compared against the equivalence bounds. If the statistical test indicates the observed data is surprising, assuming that true effects are at least as extreme as the equivalence bounds, a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences can be used to reject effect sizes larger than the equivalence bounds with a pre-specified Type 1 error rate.\n\n\nSeveral tests exist for equivalence analyses; however, more recently the Two-one-sided t-tests (TOST) procedure has been garnering considerable attention. As outlined below, this approach is an adaptation of the widely known t-test.\n\n\n“A very simple equivalence testing approach is the ‘two-one-sided t-tests’ (TOST) procedure. [Schuirmann, 1987] In the TOST procedure an upper (\\(\\Delta U\\)) and lower (-\\(\\Delta L\\)) equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest (e.g., a positive or negative difference of \\(d = 0.3\\)). Two composite null hypotheses are tested: \\(H_{01}: \\Delta \\leq –\\Delta L\\) and \\(H_{02}: \\Delta \\geq \\Delta U\\) When both these one-sided tests can be statistically rejected, we can conclude that \\(–\\Delta L < \\Delta < \\Delta U\\), or that the observed effect falls within the equivalence bounds … .[Searman et al, 1998]” [Lakens 2017]\n\nLakens offers pointers, and TOSTER package, for this approach.\nBayes factors\nSemi-aside: Unresolved discussion of ‘Bayes factors’ (Nik and Reinstein)\nClear DataColada argument against the use of ‘Bayes Factors’ for ‘accepting the null’"

    "text": "10.3 A single framework? “Significance and equivalence testing” with randomization inference/simulation; building to Bayes\n\n\n\nThis is an outline/discussion. I (DR) try to implement and demonstrate this in eamt_data_analysis/oftw_giving_season_upsell_2021_trial/oftw_upsell_input_first_analysis.Rmd\nNote: there may be good ways to hijack all sorts of existing tools, such as the bayesAB package or BayesianFirstAid\n\n\nSuppose we see a ‘small difference’ between treatment groups and it is ‘not significant in standard tests’ (tests not shown here yet).\nHow can we: - Put meaningful bounds on this? - Statistically ‘rule out large effects’? - Do this in the same context as our ‘null hypothesis tests’? - Do and communicate this in a way that is acceptable to a range of audiences?\n(This parallels the analysis done in HERE, which includes dome further explanation of the methods)\n\nI (David) propose taking the following approach:\n\nConstruct (by simulation or analytical formulae) the ‘probability of “some function of our data” given a range of true parameters, i.e., given a range of relevant ’true rates of (relative) incidence’ under each treatment (1/2, 3/4, equal, 4/3, 2, etc). This includes (and perhaps focuses on) the case where ‘the true rates of incidence are equal to one another and equal to the average empirical incidence in our sample.’\n\nWhat “function of our data”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact proportional difference in incidence rates that we see\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see (in absolute value) or larger (I believe this is the ‘two-tailed frequentist p-value’)\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see (in absolute value) or smaller (this gives us a sense of ‘how unlikely is a large true effect … can we probabilistically rule out a big difference’)\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large or larger in favor of the Treatment\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see in favor of the Control\n… Perhaps similar measures for other statistics such as ‘difference in counts (not proportional), or ’average amount (donated)’ (for the latter, we’d need to consider distinct true distributions of contributions)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the above over the parameter range to get a visual picture of the maximum likelihood parameter, and (eyeballing) the relative probability of different ranges\nFor a few important elements of the above, consider the ‘relative likelihood of the data’ under different true rates of incidence (or distributions of donations), for important comparisons such as\n\n\nA relative incidence of 1.5 versus a relative incidence of 1\n\n… If the ratio is very small we might suspect that ’no difference is far more likely than a strong difference in favor of the treatment.\n\nImplicitly considering a ‘flat prior’, integrate (average) and compare important ranges of the above\n\nE.g….\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe probability mass of the parameter ‘the incidence is 1.25x or higher in favor of the Treatment’ , versus 1.25x or lower (closer to zero, or higher incidence under the Control)…\n… If the ratio is very small, then, given a fairly flat prior, our posterior should put a low probability on ‘a large difference in favor of the treatment’ …\nAnd similarly, reversing the control and treatment\nAnd similarly, for both extremes relative to a middle incidence range…\n… here, if the ratio is very small, we will say “we can probablistically rule out an effect of 1.5x or larger in either direction”\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie:\n“To put simply, likelihood is”the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) having generated D” and posterior is essentially “the likelihood of θ having generated D” further multiplied by the prior distribution of θ. If the prior distribution is flat (or non-informative), likelihood is exactly the same as posterior.”\nSo in essence, if you wanted, you could just put a prior distribution on the differences over which you have simulated differences, and multiply it with your likelihood. To get a proper posterior you would need a continuous distribution for the prior over the parameter space, and probably more simulations across the parameter space as well, to fill in the shape of the posterior. I guess the key difference between what you are suggesting and just running it as a Bayesian binomial regression is that your likelihood function is produced by simulation, whereas the one in the Bayesian regression would be generated through the model assumptions of the regression.\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, repeat the above with a Bayesian tool, considering more than one ‘explicit prior’.\n\nOngoing question: Do we need or want a separate prior for ‘incidence under treatment’ and ‘incidence under control’, or can our prior simply focus on the relative incidence rates?\n\nJamie suggests: Just do a Bayesian analysis and consider the posterior distribution. You can test the sensitivity to different priors."

    "text": "10.4 Factor analysis\n\n10.4.1 Conceptual question 1: How can we have correlated traits but no overlap in factor loadings?\nFactors represent ‘real but latent ways people differ’ (in personality psych)\n\n“We don’t want cross-loadings” (in the case where we use sum scores). We don’t want the ‘factor loadings’ to be nonzero (or far from 0) on the same items for multiple factors.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n… We don’t want our indicators (survey measures) to be measuring more than one true factor, I guess. We don’t want questions we think are about happiness to really be picking up sociability. But can such questions be designed? Suppose the questions do pick up multiple personality characteristics. If we redefine the ‘factors’ so that they only load on separate sets of question, I don’t see how these redefined factors will be truly reflecting the personality characteristics.\nWe know\n\nthe latent personality traits are correlated (e.g., happy people are more sociable)\nThus, people who are happy will tend to be more sociable, and thus tend to respond more positively to responses to questions about happiness and questions about sociability\nSo if we restrict ‘only questions about sociability can load onto factor’, I claim that the value of this factor will tend to be higher for people who are happy (I know we are not restricting it, but that is the stated goal, so we should consider what it implies)\nThus, ‘does this imply that the factor is measuring happiness and not just sociability?’\n\nPerhaps the answer is something like\n\nYes, each sociabity question will tend to be higher for people who are happier (higher on the true ‘happiness factor’). However, the estimated ‘sociability factor level’ for an individual (summed factor loadings times individual values of items) need not be reflected in the loadings on the happiness items. If we are ‘already adequately picking up sociability’ through the loadings on the sociability questions, what remains (residual?) need not be related to the happiness items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther thoughts and insight into ‘how do PCA and FA differ?’\n\n\n\n\n\nI know what principal component analysis does: it reduces dimensionality. It projects your outcomes into a series of vectors (components) so that each ‘individual’ can be described by a value for each component. This score ‘predicts’ her value for each of the outcomes, and the algorithm does this to minimize the sum of squared differences (SSE) between the prediction and actual. A natural result of ‘minimizing the SSE’ is that each component vector will be set to be orthogonal to each other vector. How many vectors (componenets)? That’s another issue, and there are various rules of thumb and metrics.\nI know what factor analysis intends to do, and why this is conceptually different from PCA.\nExplanation here about ‘latent factors’, with genes as an example, before they were able to be observed … We only observe and measure physical and behavioral outcomes, like height, weight, math performance, and verbal performance on specific tests. We want to predict ‘how many genes determine these’ and ‘how to best predict the value of these genes for each individual’. Note that the genes themselves may be correlated. If there is a ‘growth’ gene and an ‘intelligence’ gene, they may tend to be positively related to one another, because of other factors (assortative mating, health and nutrition in early childhood, etc.)\n\nTrue ‘factors’ (genes): intelligence, growth\n\n(However, we do not know how many true factors/genes there are… we just know there are some nmber).\n\nMeasured ‘items’: height, weight, hand_size, verbal_score, math_score, spatial_score\n\nWhat I’ve been stuck on is ’mechanically, what is it that FA does to “better recover these genes (factors)” that PCA does not do. It is clearly not merely trying to maximize prediction… because that would be PCA. Maybe it maximizes predictiveness (minimizes some error term) subject to some constraints … where imposing these constraints makes it more likely that we are identifying genes, i.e., makes the factors a better estimate of these gene values.\nOne possible ‘constraint’ that might be meaningful: Maybe we know that specific genes cause (or ‘have a (causal) impact on’) certain behaviors and traits, although we do not know which ones and by how much. (A stronger assumption would be that ‘only a single gene causes each measured behavior or trait’ … but that’s probably too strong and unrealistic.) This (weaker or stronger assumption) will imply that certain traits, the traits ‘caused’ by any gene, must indeed be correlated in the population. If the ‘growth’ gene causes measured height, weight, and hand size, then people will tend to have high, medium, or low values of all of these, depending (at least in part) on the value of their growth gene. If the ‘intelligence’ gene causes measured verbal, math, and spatial performance … these will be similarly related.\nIn the other hand, the axes of variation (‘principal component vectors’) that most succinctly predict all of the measured items above might involve ‘substantial mixing’ of the physical measures and scores, even measures that do not themselves tend to be strongly correlated to one another. In other words, multiple items given positive weights in each vector might actually be negatively correlated in the population. Why?\nIs this a helpful example?: The data may mix people from two cities, one of which pushes fatty foods but has great math education. This may then lead to the most predictive vectors (here I state them as sums, crossing them with the values) being something like (wait, I need to make these orthogonal … ugh) \\(V1 = -1 height + 7 weight + 8 math - 1 verbal -1 spatial\\) and \\(V2 = 2 height -3 weight + 2 math + 1 verbal + 8 spatial\\). But in fact, (do we know this?) height and weight are correlated in the population, as are all of the ‘intelligence’ scores. The psychometrician doesn’t know this (because this is ‘exploratory’), but they do know that whatever the latent factors are, they will imply items all caused by the factor, and thus given positive weights within a factor must (?) be correlated to one another. (At least if multiple, negatively correlated genes/factors are not each having important impacts on these items).\nSo the psychometrician says (perhaps driven by some theoretical model of genes, stated in explicit equations):\n\nI am going to require that, whatever my factors are, the items given substantial positive weights within them must be positively correlated in the population\n\nBut what are ‘substantial positive weights’? Perhaps the metric itself is weighted; the more positive the weights in each factor, the more correlated the items must be.\nThis then may lead them to estimate a sort of ‘constrained PCA’ model … maximizing the predictiveness under the constraint like \\(R_{12} := \\rho(\\gamma_1 x_1, \\gamma_2 x_2) > 0.6 \\forall x_1, x_2\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is a Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and the \\(\\gamma\\)’s represent the factor loadings on any two items \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nOr perhaps, rather than a constaint, the FA may maximize a value function that considers both these \\(R_{ij}\\) measures and the predictive power (the latter as in PCA).\nIf the ‘theory is correct’ and ‘factors tend to contain correlated items’, then imposing the constraint (or ‘reward in the value function’) that items should be correlated, will likely yeild better estimates of the true factors.\nBut what does this say about ‘using FA to choose which items to include?’\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Suggested readings\n\n“Best practices in EFA” (Jason W.

For this model to be useful for an actual prediction problem going forward, it would need to rely on ‘ex-ante’ characteristic that were already observable at the time of a career/EtG/pledge decision.1 These might include immutable demographics, career plans, and pledges previously taken, and consider year and trend effects.\nAlthough we have these models in mind, this is not what we are doing here. We are not posing a specific ‘prediction problem’ per se. Instead we are using machine learning tools built for prediction problems to generate ‘data-driven insights’ about factors related to EA donation behavior. Here, we do not than directly specifying all of the included components of the model (features, interaction terms, etc.). Instead we provide a large set of possible ‘inputs’ and use ML techniques to train models that should predict well outside of the data they are trained on. These models should do a good job of accomplishing the task: ‘if you gave me a set of features of an EA, I should have a fairly accurate guess at what they will donate.’\nThe insights from these models should also be treated with caution. Again, they may not be deriving causal relationships. Furthermore, the parameters derived from model-fitting ML procedures are not in general unbiased or consistent, and it is difficult to derive proper confidence intervals for these parameters.\nStill, the benefit of this exercise may be considered ‘the derivation of robust and predictive relationships in the data that are mainly driven by the data itself, rather than our preconcieved ideas.’ These models may also be useful building blocks towards future predictive work."

The penalties are specifically ‘tuned’ and ‘validated’ to maximize the predictive power of the model. As these are essentially regression approaches, we can report the sign and magnitude of the coefficients used in the ‘optimally tuned’ predictive model. (However, we should be careful about interpreting these parameters, and statistical inference is challenging. See e.g., (Mullainathan2017?) for a detailed discussion.)\nThe GLMnet approach combines ‘ridge (L2 norm) and lasso (L2 norm)’, tuning the mix of each, as well as tuning the penalization parameters within each.\nBoth the sum of absolute value coefficients (L1 norm) and the summed square of these (L2 norm) ma y be penalized. Thus, these will be ‘shrunk towards zero’ relative to a comparable OLS (standard linear model) estimate. How much do we ‘charge’ for the absolute or squared sums? This is ‘tuned’, i.e., we see what combinations perform best in the cross-validation exercise.\nIn some cases (because of the L1 norm), coefficients may be dropped entirely, i.e., ‘shrunk all the way to zero’.2"

In other words, ‘how far off’ are the predictions and classifications on average, from the actual outcomes. This procedure considers the fit on randomly-drawn set-aside ‘testing data’, data that has not been used in ‘training’ (or ‘fitting’) the model.\nIn the vignette here we consider and discuss the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE) metrics in the context of predicting donatino outcomes.\nIn order to assess the usefulness of each predictive regression model we consider both root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE). RMSE (aka RMSD) can be interpreted as the average ‘Euclidean distance’ between the actual values and the model’s prediction. For each observation (in the set-aside ‘testing sample’), to construct RMSE we:\n\nMeasure the differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation)\nSquare these differences\nTake the average of these squared differences across all observations\nTake the square root of this\n\nTo construct mean-absolute-error (MAE) we simply\n\nMeasure the absolute-value differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation) for each observation\nTake the average of these across all observations\n\nMAE has a much more straightforward interpretation: it simply asks ‘how far off are we, on average?’\nWhile the RMSE is used in the model fitting for various reasons, it is arguably less-interpretable and less-relevant than MAE in judging the model’s fit in cases like this one. RMSE error negatively assesses the model fit based on squared deviations, and is thus very sensitive to ‘large mistakes’. This may be relevant where ‘large errors are much much worse than small ones’ – here, this is not so clearly the case. In the presence of data with large outlying observations, prediction will tend to be poor by this measure.\nNote that when considering models where the outcome is transformed (e.g., log(donations)) we construct the RMSE and MAE by exponentiating to generate predictions for the level outcomes, and then measure the deviations on the level scale.3"

Since time series problems involve time-ordered rows where past events may influence future events, the rows are not independent and this independence assumption is violated.\nAnother key assumption of ML is that the training data is similar to the data being predicted (in this case, future data). This assumption must be true for time series as well.\n\n12.1.1 Decomposition\nYou can decompose a time series into four key parts:\n\nThe trend (T), where the mean is changing over time (e.g., sales generally keep increasing over time)\nSeasonality (S) (e.g., sales are higher in the holiday season)\nA non-seasonal cyclical (C) component (e.g., stock market follows “business cycles”).

Note also that nonstationary series can be described as following a ‘random walk’\n\n\nBut I’m also not convinced that this should necessarily be a problem in a prediction problem.

You can lag the target variable (e.g., use last month’s sales to predict next month’s sales) and/or you can lag independent variables. Lagged target variables often have strong explanatory power because the real world has delays (e.g., it takes a few weeks for marketing to transition to sales so marketing spend from three weeks ago may be more predictive than marketing spend of the same week) and causations that occur over time (e.g., sales from last year show that the store is more popular so there is more word of mouth and it is even more popular the next year).\nLagging always involves losing some data, as if you are using data from the previous month you won’t be able to use the first month in your training data (because there’s no previous month data for month -1). If you are using data from the three previous months, you won’t be able to train on the first three months. This may not be an issue though, because unlike with non-time series problems, more data in time series isn’t always better (since you might prefer to only be modeling the most recent trend).\nWe can mix lags of different lengths.\n\n\n12.3.2 Rolling Statistics\nLags aren’t the only thing we can do - we can also calculate rolling statistics, like the mean of a variable over the past 14 days.

Also can assess with the autocorrelation function (ACF), which does not control for other lags.\n\nchanging lag lengths based on data type, domain knowledge, and how quickly you think the series reacts to change (e.g., use shorter lags for stocks)\ncompare by backtesting\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Known in Advance vs. Not\nWhen we are trying to predict in the future, we run into an issue that the features we are using for prediction might also be unknown at prediction time. For example, our historical data might contain information about rainfall and how that connects to sales, but we can’t reliably know the rainfall three months in the future to predict future sales.\nHowever, some features are known in advance - like Christmas time may also have a big impact on sales and we always know exactly when Christmas will be.\nFor features that are not known in advance, we can still use them by either explicitly forecasting them, extrapolating them out using lags / rolling stats of sufficient size, or extrapolating from current values using differing forecast differences."

For example, some of them have mustaches, some wear pointed hats, some have sinister cackles and lapdogs to a greater or less or degree, and some appear to be more wealthy than others… Let us suppose that: We have previous similar suspect populations that we know to be the same in nature (‘drawn from an identical pool’) to the future suspect populations that we will need to make these predictions for We ultimately learned with certainty which of the previous suspect populations turned out to be spies (To keep intuition and calculation simple) suppose that in these populations know that half of all of these people are spies, and half are completely innocent. (This is called ‘balanced classes’).\nWe are asked to come up with a method to use the observable characteristics to classify each individual as more or less likely to be a spy. If we are given a group of individuals’ characteristics our method needs to assign a number to each one that might be interpreted as the “likelihood this person is a spy”. For example our ‘model’ we might say “anyone with a mustache is 75% likely to be a spy, and anyone without a mustache is 25% likely to be a spy.” (If half of the population wears mustaches, this would also give us an average prediction in line with the known overall 50% spy rate.) Or, let’s make the ‘model’ a bit more complicated (but to allow ‘ordering’ predictions) … we might say … we give the probability of being a spy as\n\\(0.75 - 0.25*wtdev\\)\nif they wear a moustache and\n\\(0.25 - 0.25*wtdev\\) otherwise.\nwhere \\(wtdev\\) represents some “normalized” measure of the person’s weight relative to the average weight in the sample, We predict skinnier people are slightly more likely to be spies.\nNote that, since everyone’s weight is slightly different, this will yield a slightly different projected probability for any observed individual. Thus, our model could also be seen as a “ranking” where, for any group of individuals we are given we can order them from least likely to be a spy (the fattest clean-shaven people) to most likely to be a spy (the skinniest moustache-wearer).\nHow should we evaluate a model, in absolute terms, or against other models? This depends on how the models predictions will be used and on the cost of getting it right or wrong in either direction.\nOur model might be applied by a very soft judge (think Mr. Van Driessen from B&B) who thinks it is much worse to convict an innocent person then to set free many spies. On the other hand it might be applied by a very tight-ass judge (think the gym coach) who puts almost no cost on convicting the innocent … he just wants to cath spies. How can we conceive of the ‘success’ of our model? (edited)\n\nWe could compare across different models to see if one does ‘universally better or worse’ in a sense to be defined. Suppose each model both gives a probability of being a spy for each person. As noted, this implies that each model “rank-orders” a population of individuals in terms of most to least likely being a spy.\n\n\nIn a given (test) set of data, we might see something like the number line dots thing above. The person our model claims is most likely to be a spy is on the right and the one predicted least likely is on the left. In application the liberal judge (“vDriessen”) might convict only the “top 1/3” of the distribution, while the tight-ass (“Coach”) might put 2/3 of these ‘dots’ in prison. Each have made different types of mistakes in practice. vDriessen let a bunch of spies free (and falsely convicted only a few), while the Coach put a lot of innocent people in prison (and, in practice, but not in the dots example above, also let a few spies free). (edited)\nWe might consider that our model has some probability of being applied by various types of judges. It might be that our model performs “better” than an alternative model when applied by the liberal vDriessen but “worse” when applied by the strict Coach. On the other hand, we can imagine that some models might perform better for nearly all types of judge! How could we measure this? The ROC curve can be helpful:\n\nAbove we see models that are strictly ordered from best to worse … the lines do not cross (this need not always be the case). The blue line to picks or model that is strictly better than the orange line, which is itself strictly better than a “random classifier”. A ‘random classifier’ give us no information. If we use this we can only choose some probability to convict everyone. Using this, if we increase the rate we can convict people by 2 per 100, then on average we are convicting one more spy and one more innocent person, in our example. So, by what measure is the blue classifier ‘better’ than the orange one (and both are better than the random classifier)? (edited)\nRemember, each classifier gives a ‘ranked ordering’ of the population. Suppose that we consider going down the list from the most guilty looking to the most innocent looking, and increasing the number of people that we choose to convict.\nAs we go down the ranking in general and decide to convict a larger share of the population we are adding some possibility of convicting and innocent person (the ‘cost’) to gain the ‘benefit’ of convicting some true spies. As depicted in the ROC curves above, as we do this the blue curve (classifier) is achieving a better tradeoff than the orange, green or red curve … (this is because it gives us a ‘better ordered list of who us more likely to be guilty’)…\nAs the judge using the blue curve decides to go further down the ‘blue curve list’ (paying the cost of convicting more innocent people) he also catches more spies than if he had used the ‘orange, green, or red curve list’ . The benefit to cost ratio is higher at all ‘rates of conviction’ here.

This is a more economical way of testing the Urn of Mystery example than having a warehouse full of thousands of urns filled with green and red marbles. Consider that there are 1000 urns in the simulated warehouse, each with 0% to 100% green marbles. The percentage of green marbles are generated separately for each urn using a uniform distribution (the maximum possible uncertainty in this case). A marble is drawn at random from each urn. The probability of drawing a green marble is, obviously, just the percentage of marbles that are green. So, for each urn, the color of the randomly drawn marble is determined with a binary distribution using the percentage of green marbles as the chance of drawing green. Otherwise, red is drawn. In this simulation, we pretend the drawing person does not see the real percentage of green marbles in the urn. The person only uses the drawn marble to determine whether to bet the majority is green or red. We then determine whether that single draw turned out to be the majority color. We can see that after 1000 urns the single draw is the same color as the majority about 75% of the time.\n\n\n\n\nThe above (folded) narrative is rather confusing, and the spreadsheet is rather bulky. We can explain it and simulate it much more simply by using code. The point is… [what was the point again?]\n\nRandomly draw a ‘share green’ for each urn, for each of 1000 (or ‘\\(K=1000\\)’) ‘urns’, and record the majority color, i.e., is it more than half green?\n\n\nWe set the value ‘K=1000’, which we could adjust later, indicating ‘how many urns’ we are using in our simulation. It makes it clearer to define things at the top and see how it drives the results.\n\nCodeK <- 1000\n\nurns <- runif(K, 0, 1)\n\n\nThe code above yields the object urns, a vector of 1000 probabilities. It assigns ‘urns’ to be equal to the function runif, i.e., ‘random uniform’.\n2\n3 We could view the whole thing in several ways, such as by typing view(urns) or View(urns) for a peek. We can also have any part of this printed to the screen. The point is that this object is there in the background (in our ‘environment’). We don’t need to see it in front of us, at all times, as with a spreadsheet.\nPrinting out a peek at this object:\n\nCodestr(urns)\n\n num [1:1000] 0.973 0.35 0.426 0.559 0.972 ...\n\n\nThe object is a ‘numeric vector’ with 1000 elements, the first 5 or so are listed. Each of these represent\n\nFor each of (\\(K= 1000\\)) urns, randomly draw a single marble, and record whether this draw is the same as the urn’s majority color.4\n\n\nWe put this together into a ‘tibble’ data frame below5\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\n\nK <- 1000\n\nurns <- tibble(\n    share_green = runif(K, 0, 1), #recreating the vector of uniform draws as the first column of a tibble\n    majority = if_else(share_green > .5, \"green\", \"red\"), #classifying whether the tibble is majority green or red\n    draw = if_else(runif(K) > share_green, \"red\", \"green\") #if another random uniform draw exceeds the 'share green' in that urn, it's a draw of a red ball. Note this is doing this for the entire vector runif(K) atonce\n  ) \n\n\n\nDisplay this ‘matrix’ of 1000 outcomes (or a peek at it)\n\n\nCodeurns\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 3\n   share_green majority draw \n         <dbl> <chr>    <chr>\n 1       0.690 green    red  \n 2       0.354 red      red  \n 3       0.166 red      red  \n 4       0.260 red      red  \n 5       0.586 green    green\n 6       0.821 green    red  \n 7       0.458 red      red  \n 8       0.714 green    red  \n 9       0.338 red      red  \n10       0.799 green    green\n# … with 990 more rows\n\n\nThe snip above shows how these ‘random draws’ are generated, as noted above.\n\n\nCount ‘which share of these agree with their urn’s majority color’\n\n\nCode(\n  share_agree <- summarize(urns, share_agree = sum(draw == majority) / K)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  share_agree\n        <dbl>\n1       0.731\n\nCode#sum number of cases where the 'draw is the same color as the majority for the urn\n\n\nI.e., 73.1% of the draws are the same color as the majority of their urn.6\nThe above code is not as elegant as it should be, and we should clean it up. Still I think this is better than using the Excel spreadsheet. Why? It gives you more control, a better record of what you have done, the ability to do more powerful analysis, and you can do more with the results (such as embedding them into a dynamic document like this one).\nFor one example, suppose you wanted to test this with 1 million urns. That would be a huge pain to do in Excel… I dare you to try it. In R we simply change the code to specify \\(K =1,000,000\\) urns, and do the above again.7\n\nCodeK <- 1000*1000\n\n\nurns <- tibble(\n    share_green = runif(K, 0, 1),\n    majority = if_else(share_green > .5, \"green\", \"red\"), \n    draw = if_else(runif(K) > share_green, \"red\", \"green\") \n  ) \n\n(\n  share_agree <- sum(urns$draw == urns$majority)/K\n  )\n\n[1] 0.750051\n\n\nOn my computer, this ran almost immediately.\n\n15.1.1 Tools for Monte-Carlo Fermi, other than Excel\nSome links to simple vignettes in other tools\n\nCausal, buy vs rent\nGuesstimate: simplest trivial example\nGuesstimate, slightly more involved: deep work before death of your mind\nSquiggle notebook, GiveDirectly/Givewell mode\nR code (working on it)"

    "text": "17.4 How likely are ‘proportions this similar’ under different size ‘true effect sizes’?1\n\nIn the next section I started an off-the-cuff simulation approach, in folded code. But I believe that the analytical form here with code and a simulation here should be applicable.\n\n17.4.1 Difference between two binomial random variables.\nReprinting and discussing from Stackexchange post\n“derive the distribution of the difference between two binomial random variables.”\n\nI can give you an answer for the pmf of X-Y. From there |X - Y| is straightforward.\n\n\nSo we start with\n\\(X \\sim Bin(n_1, p_1)\\)\n\\(Y \\sim Bin(n_2, p_2)\\)\nWe are looking for the probability mass function of \\(Z=X-Y\\)\n\nNote: in our case we (arguably) care about the difference in ‘proportion of incidences’, but as we also have similar sample sizes (\\(n_1 \\approx n_2\\)) this is basically a normalization\n\nFirst note that the min and max of the support of Z must be \\((-n_2, n_1)\\) since that covers the most extreme cases (\\(X=0\\) and \\(Y=n_2\\)) and (\\(X=n_1\\) and \\(Y=0\\)).\nThen we need a modification of the binomial pmf so that it can cope with values outside of its support.\n\\(m(k, n, p) = \\binom {n} {k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\) when \\(k \\leq n\\) and 0 otherwise.\n\nNote that this “modified binomial” is what the statistics::dbinom function in R returns.\n\nThen we need to define two cases\n\n\\(Z \\geq 0\\)\n\\(Z \\lt 0\\)\n\nIn the first case\n\\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2)\\)\nsince this covers all the ways in which X-Y could equal z.\n\nBecause \\((i+z) - i = z\\), of course … ‘sum up’ the probability of each of these ‘co-occurances’\n\nFor example when z=1 this is reached when X=1 and Y=0 and X=2 and Y=1 and X=3 and Y=4 and so on. It also deals with cases that could not happen because of the values of \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). For example if \\(n_2 = 4\\) then we cannot get Z=1 as a combination of X=4 and Y=5. In this case thanks to our modified binomial pmf the probablity is zero.\nFor the second case we just reverse the roles. For example if z=-1 then this is reached when X=0 and Y=1, X=1 and Y=2 etc.\n\\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2)\\)\nPut them together and that’s your pmf.\n\n\\(f(z)=\\)\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n    \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2),& \\text{if } z\\geq 0\\\\\n    \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2),              & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nHere’s the function in R and a simulation to check it’s right (and it does work.) https://gist.github.com/ragscripts/9681819\n\nLet me try to apply it…\nDefining their code for this function: ::: {.cell}\nCodemodBin <-dbinom #DR: I just do this renaming here for consistency with the rest ... but the modBin they defined was redundant\n\ndiffBin<-function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){\n\n  prob <- 0\n\n  if (z>=0){\n    for (i in 1:n1){\n      prob <- prob + modBin(i+z, n1, p1) * modBin(i, n2, p2)\n    }\n\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    for (i in 1:n2){\n      prob<-prob+modBin(i+z, n1, p1)*modBin(i, n2, p2)\n    }\n  }\n  return(prob)\n}\n:::\n\n17.4.2 Applying this to present data\nRather than using their example, I’ll dive right in to the present case.\nMy notes on the outcomes as of 15 Dec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment 1 - Impact and Treatment 2 - Emotion Story tabs\nTreatment 1: We record - 8 unique emails donating, 26 donations in total, - worth 5200 USD in total - 1345 unique emails listed as getting ‘control’ treatment 1\nTreatment 2: - 6 unique emails, 28 donations so far — worth 7500 USD in total. - 1190 unique emails listed for treatment 2\nIf I believe my ‘unique emails count’, that implies an 0.59% ‘conversion’ rate for T1 - Control a 0.50% conversion rate for T2 - Emotion/Story\n\n\n\nPutting the observations into defined objects (later: do from data)\n\nCoden1 <- 1345\nn2 <- 1190\nd1 <- 8\nd2 <- 6\nz <- d1-d2\n\n\nComputation for a few ‘ad-hoc cases’ (later explore the space with vectors of values)\n\nSuppose truly equal incidence, at the mean level\n\n\nCodep1 <- (d1+d2)/(n1+n2)\n\np2 <- p1\n\n(\n  db_0 <- diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n)\n\n[1] 0.1024599\n\n\nThis implies there is a 10.2% chance of getting this exact difference of +2 incidences between the treatments (in one direction), if the true incidence rates were equal.\nLet’s plot this for a range of ‘incidence rate differences’ in this region. (Sorry, using the traditional plot, ggplot is better).\n\nCodes <- seq(-10*z, 10*z)\np<-sapply(s, function(z) diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2))\nplot(s,p)\n\n\n\n\nWe see a large likelihood of values in the range of the +2 difference observed, and a low likelihood of a difference of 10 or more in either direction.\n\n17.4.3 Adaptation: ‘of this magnitude or smaller’\n\nCodeltmag_diffBin <- function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){\n  prob <- 0\n  z_n <- -z #negative value\n\n  for (i in z_n:z){     #sum for all integer differences between observed value and its negative, inclusive\n    prob <- prob + diffBin(i, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n    }\n\n  return(prob)\n}\n\n\nNow, a similar computation as above, but for ‘this big or smaller in magnitude’:\n\nCode  (\n    mag_db_0 <- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n  )\n\n[1] 0.4908031\n\n\nThis implies there is a 49.1% chance of getting a difference no larger than this one in magnitude of +/-2 incidences between the treatments if the true incidence rates were equal.\n\nAnd finally, what we were looking for: the chance of ‘a difference this small or smaller’ as a function of the true difference…\nSet up an arbitrary vector of ‘true differences’ (to keep it simple, only change it in one direction for now …)\nBelow, I plot\nY-axis: ’how likely would a difference in donations ‘as small or smaller in magnitude’” than we see in the data against\nX-axis: if the “true difference in incidence rates” were of these magnitudes\n\nCodeoptions(scipen=999)\n\nB <- c(1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 10)\n\np1 <- rep((d1+d2)/(n1+n2), length(B))\np2 <- p1*B\n\n\nas.list(ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)*100) %>% format(digits=3, scientific=FALSE)\n\n[1] \"49.1\"             \"39.4\"             \"20.6\"             \"8.02\"            \n[5] \"2.51\"             \"0.153\"            \"0.00000000000855\"\n\nCodeprobmag <- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n\n\n#qplot(B, probmag, log  = \"x\", xlab = \"True relative incidence\", ylab =\"Prob. of difference this small\")\n\n(\n  probmag_plot <-\n    ggplot() +\n  aes(x=B, y=probmag) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +\n    ylim(0,.51) +\n    xlab(\"True relative incidence rate\") +\n    ylab(\"Prob. diff. as small as obsd\")\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nHard-coded takeaways 15 Dec 2021 :\nOur data is consistent with ‘no difference’ (of course) … but its also consistent with ‘a fairly large difference in incidence’\nE.g., even if one treatment truly lead to ‘twice as many donations as the other’, we still have a 20% chance of seeing a differences as small as the one we see (of 8 versus 6)\nWe can reasonably ‘rule out’ differences of maybe 2.5x or greater\nMain point: given the rareness of donations in this context, our sample size doesn’t let us make very strong conclusions in either directions … at least not yet. I hope that combined with other evidence, we will be able to infer more"

Typically we have to make a chain of non-independent predictions rather than predict discrete, independent events.\n\nDR: this prediction problem should be distinguished from ‘time series econometrics’, see, e.g., Diebold’s text, which focuses on estimating fundamental structural parameters, and considers forms of ‘causality’.\n\nMost machine learning problems assume that the order of rows don’t matter and that each row is independent of each other. Since time series problems involve time-ordered rows where past events may influence future events, the rows are not independent and this independence assumption is violated.\nAnother key assumption of ML is that the training data is similar to the data being predicted (in this case, future data). This assumption must be true for time series as well.\n\n12.1.1 Decomposition\nYou can decompose a time series into four key parts:\n\nThe trend (T), where the mean is changing over time (e.g., sales generally keep increasing over time)\nSeasonality (S) (e.g., sales are higher in the holiday season)\nA non-seasonal cyclical (C) component (e.g., stock market follows “business cycles”). This is distinct from seasonality as seasonality has a fixed period (e.g., every November), whereas a cycle does not.\nA random component (e)\n\n\nDR: The ‘random component’ could be distinguised or described further; there are various types of ‘random’ terms … shifts, changes in trends, ‘moving average’ one-off terms, ‘autoregressive’ error terms\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Types of decomposition\nThere are two basic types of decomposition – addititive, where y = T + S + C + e and multiplicative, where y = T * S * C * e."
