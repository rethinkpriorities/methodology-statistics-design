    "text": "Discussion and framework\nIntroduction and goals\nThe purpose of this document is to propose the fundamentals for a workflow for power analyses.\nAlthough this started from a Bayesian paradigm, the overarching framework is applicable to any analytic approach, and I will begin with a standard frequentist analysis.2\nThe general approach laid out here can be the basis for developing and build a library of common analyses and inference goals.3 Helpful future additions to the toolkit would include\n\nclear and flexible ways to generate hypothetical data sets, and\nadding further analytic designs.4\n\nThis is not intended as an exhaustive introduction to the fundamentals of statistical power–I assume you are reasonably well-versed in some general principles of statistical inference and hypothesis testing, as well as in the basic idea of what power analysis is.5\nWe will focus solely on ‘simulation-based’ power analysis,6 and not on ways of mathematically (analytically) deriving power.\nDefinition of power\nIn frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), power is typically defined as ‘the probability that we can reject the null hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis is indeed true’ (i.e., power is the ‘true positive rate’). More precisely, we may express this as ‘power against a particular alternative hypothesis’.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom wikipedia: The statistical power of a binary hypothesis test…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statistical power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when a specific alternative hypothesis \\(H_{1}\\) is true. It is commonly denoted by \\(1-\\beta\\), and represents the chances of a “true positive” detection conditional on the actual existence of an effect to detect. … as the power of a test increases, the probability \\(\\beta\\) of making a type II error by wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis decreases.\nlink accessed 12 Apr 2022\n\n\n\nNote that some Bayesian statisticians question the validity and usefulness of this presentation of power analysis.8\nBefore we conduct an experiment (or run a survey, or collect data for an analysis), there are many hypothetical future data sets we might observe. Whether we favor a frequentist or Bayesian approach, it seems reasonable to ask: ‘Given the range of data that I might observe, how likely is it that I can make certain conclusions?’. 9\nWe can broaden the idea of power to indicate the probability that our proposed sample yields information that allows us to make some specific kind of inference about the data-generating process.\nGiven a particular underlying effect (or range of effects, or lack thereof), and a particular sample size (or range of sample sizes), we ask ‘what is the probability of’… ?:10\n\n‘determining’ that there is a non-zero difference between two conditions,11\n\ndetecting some ‘smallest effect size of interest’,\na ‘false positive’,12\n\nachieving a desired level of precision around a particular parameter estimate, or\nfinding an effect ‘likely equivalent to zero’ or ‘unlikely to be far from zero’.13\n\n\nHence, a power analysis helps frame our prospective research project in relation to the goals we would like to achieve.14 It provides uswith an estimate (and it is indeed an estimate, not a certainty!) of the probability that we will be able to make the inference we wish to make, given various factors both inside and outside of our control. (See discussion in fold.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is ‘in our control’?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might think of sample size as in our control, which it generally is, but this is typically limited by practical considerations outside of our control (such as the availability of a sample or financial constraints). Conversely, effect size is often considered out of our control ; however we can sometimes increase the ‘dosage’ we give, or try to select a particular group of participants who might be particularly susceptible to our effect of interest.\n\n\n\nGeneral workflow for simulation-based power analysis\nSimulation-based power analysis proceeds in four primary steps:\n\n\nGenerate a large number of ‘simulated data sets’ for the analysis.15\n\n\nWe generate data sets generated to be specific to the study’s goal. E.g., suppose we want to know the ‘power to detect an effect size of 0.2 SD’.16 Here, for considering the true positive and false negative rates, we should generate data that reflects this effect size. If we also want to measure the rate of type-2 error17 we should also generate data reflecting a ‘null effect’.\n\nRun the proposed analysis over the many simulated data sets. (Do this as efficiently as possible, as it can take a long time.) This analysis should either return the estimand of interest, or ensure that we can easily compute it (in Step 3). The output should be kept as flexible as possible (while conserving computer memory). This will allow us to assess multiple inference goals on the same output.18\nSummarize the output returned in Step 2. Compute the share of simulated data sets that meet particular inference goals or decision criteria. (Example described in fold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: a simple case of simulating data to measure power\n\n\n\n\n\nE.g., we might simulate 1000 data sets based on an effect size of 0.3 standard deviations and perform a standard t-test of the difference between treatment and control for each of these. We might then find that for 743 of 1000 of these simulated data, the test ‘rejected the null hypothesis’, suggesting a power of 74.3%.\n\n\n\n\nThis can show the likelihood of achieving a range of goals (under various sample sizes and design and testing choices) including the rates of misleading conclusions. In frequentist analyses, steps 2 and 3 can often be done together (e.g., the p-value is returned along with the other output). In my experience with typical Bayesian designs, these stages are best kept separate so that we can first do the more time-consuming Step 2, and then more freely explore the various options in Step 3.\n\n\nAssess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results. If not, consider alternative design or data-collection choices (including sample sizes, treatments, and treatment assignments) or inference goals, and return to Step 1.19\n\n\nIn the following sections, we present some generally useful packages and functions for power analyses. We give annotated code examples, highlighting useful aspects. We do this in the context of a frequentist power analysis for between-groups analysis.20\n21\nPossible pitfalls/misunderstandings of power analysis\nPower analyses are a useful tool for considering the basic plausibility of achieving certain goals. But they are not an ‘omniscient oracle’, and may be somewhat of a blunt instrument. They might better be termed ‘power projections’ or ‘power estimates’. Even if we estimate that we have 99.9% power for detecting some a particular effect, we may have specified our simulations in an unrealistic way. When we actually run an experiment, we might see (e.g.) far more underlying variation or measurement error than we predicted, leading our analyses to be fairly uninformative. Conversely, we might be overly conservative with our power analysis; perhaps a design we thought was ‘underpowered’ actually has a high probability of producing very compelling results.\nConsidering: when can power analyses be helpful? and when can they be limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntricate data exploration versus broad inference\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we see real data and real interesting patterns emerge, we are likely to go further in modeling and investigating these patterns than some of the more simple analyses and comparisons we conduct in the initial power analysis. I suspect power analyses are not so good for determining all the intricate, in-depth things we might plumb in a dataset. They are probably better at assessing the tractability of a broad inference goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex models, forking paths, and tractibility\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might want to give some consideration to how far we wish to go in the initial data simulation step to think about all sorts of hypothetical data sets. As models become more complex, the number of different parameters that might vary - with possible effects on power - starts to balloon. E.g., even in a simple repeated-measures example, do we wish to vary not only the effect size but all sorts of different correlations from pre- to post-treatment within subjects? If we are simulating ordinal data, then power might change depending on how we initially suggest binning the outcomes, but there are infinitely many ways we might think the data might look… Discussion and consideration of how far we should go with these things is welcome and could be useful! (DR: I’m not sure what you are getting at here. Are you saying that ‘the space of designs and proposed analyses we can explore is extremely large, and we may need to make some ad-hoc choices to avoid this getting unmanageable’?)"

When developing a data set for the first time, one would usually go further with some ‘diagnostic’ checks to confirm that the data is behaving as you intended.24\nEfficiently generate many data sets\nNow we just need to run the function above many times over. This could be done using loops, but a very useful set of R functions in the tidyverse is the purrr package of map functions. Even better, a package called furrr is available to run such map functions in parallel to further reduce time.25 For furrr to do this, we need to tell it to plan for ‘multisession’, and give it a seed: 26\n\nCodep_load(furrr)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\nplan(multisession)\noptions <- furrr_options(seed = 48238)\n\n\nCode: We map over all 500 elements of the vector nsims to create 500 simulated data sets.27\n\nCode# we will pass N = 500 simulations to the map function\nnsims <- 1:500\n\n# the map function will run our data-making function over nsims=500 simulations\nsim.data <- furrr::future_map_dfr(\n  .x = nsims,\n  .f = four.group.datamaker,\n  a = 0,\n  b = .1,\n  c = .2,\n  d = .4,\n  .options = options\n)\n\n# split the simulated data into the separate simulations\nsim.data <- sim.data %>% group_by(sim) %>% group_split()\n\n\nNow, we have 500 simulated data sets representing our hypothetical outcome data, and can perform analyses on them.

For a Bayesian analysis, this step might involve dropping parts of the posterior that are not relevant28 and ensuring we get the parts we care about (e.g., we might insert additional code to retrieve a posterior distribution for Cohen’s d).29\nFor frequentist analyses, there are also a range of estimands we might care about, depending on your estimation and inference goals. For example, we might consider returning a p-value, or the upper and lower bounds for confidence intervals, or r-squared estimates, etc.\nThe key point for any kind of analysis here is that you don’t want to forget an estimand that might be of interest and then have to re-run the entire analysis. In addition, you want to have the analysis run on different sample sizes of the data, so that you can generate a *power curve plot() for the analysis, showing how your power changes as you increase the sample size.\nIn the example function below, we run a simple linear regression, predicting the response from group.\n\nCodelinear.reg.maker <- function(data, breaks) {\n\n  # this function cuts the data set it is given into different sample sizes\n  cut.samples <- function(break.point, data) {\n    cut.data <- filter(data, sample.size <= break.point) %>%\n      mutate(sample.size = break.point)\n    return(cut.data)\n  }\n\n  data.cuts <- map_dfr(.x = breaks, .f = cut.samples, data = data)\n\n  # the data is split according to the sample size\n  # to feed to the regression model\n  data.cuts <- data.cuts %>% group_by(sample.size) %>% group_split()\n\n  # this function runs the regression\n  run.reg <- function(data) {\n\n    four.group.form <- as.numeric(ordinal) ~ 1 + group\n\n    four.group.reg <-\n      lm(formula = four.group.form,\n           data = data)\n\n    # we extract confidence intervals for the parameters of interest\n    ci99 <- confint(four.group.reg, level = .99)\n    ci95 <- confint(four.group.reg, level = .95)\n\n    # we create an output to show the confidence intervals around the effects\n    # and some additional inference info, e.g., 'nonzero' indicates whether\n    # the lower bound of the CI excludes 0 or not.\n    # 'width' indicates the width of the confidence interval,\n    # for assessment of precision\n    output <- tibble(group = c('small', 'medsmall', 'medium',\n                               'small', 'medsmall', 'medium'),\n                     interval = c(.99, .99, .99, .95, .95, .95),\n                     lower = c(ci99[[2,1]], ci99[[3,1]], ci99[[4,1]],\n                               ci95[[2,1]], ci95[[3,1]], ci95[[4,1]]),\n                     upper = c(ci99[[2,2]], ci99[[3,2]], ci99[[4,2]],\n                               ci95[[2,2]], ci95[[3,2]], ci95[[4,2]])) %>%\n      mutate('nonzero' = case_when(lower > 0 ~ 1,\n                                   TRUE ~ 0),\n             'width' = abs(upper - lower),\n             'sim' = data[[1, 'sim']],\n             'cell.size' = nrow(data)/4)\n\n    return(output)\n  }\n\n  # run the regression function over the different sample sizes\n  output <- map_df(.x = data.cuts, .f = run.reg)\n\n  return(output)\n}\n\n\nOnce we have made and tested that our function works as intended and returns the values we want to make inferences from, we can run it over the many simulated data sets:\n\nCodet1 <- Sys.time()\nlinreg.output <- future_map_dfr(.x = sim.data,\n                                .f = linear.reg.maker,\n                                breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150))\nt2 <- Sys.time()\nt2 - t1\n\nTime difference of 16.79841 secs\n\n\nThe object linreg.output is now a large dataframe, cataloguing whether or not certain inference thresholds were reached across the many simulations. In the third primary step, we can summarise and graphically display this information.\nStep 3: Summarise the output returned in Step 2 to determine likelihood of achieving various inferential goals\nNow, we wish to ascertain how likely we are to achieve a range of inferential goals, depending on factors such as the sample size, the underlying effect sizes, or whatever else we varied in simulating our data and running our models. For this example, this is as simple as generating a summary of the output from Step 2:\n\nCode# group the data according to group, confidence interval, and size per group\nfour.group.lin.summary <- linreg.output %>% group_by(group, interval, cell.size) %>%\n  # summarise the amount of times we get a CI greater than 0\n  summarise(.groups = 'keep',\n            'ci above 0 vs. control' = sum(nonzero)/5)  %>%\n  # change some factors for plotting\n  mutate(interval = factor(interval, levels = c('0.95', '0.99'),\n                           labels = c('95% CI', '99% CI')),\n         'Effect size' = factor(group, levels = c('small', 'medsmall', 'medium'),\n                                labels = c('Very small (.1)', 'Small (.2)', 'Medium (.4)')))\n\n\nAnd then plotting the resulting power curve:\n\nCodeggplot(data = four.group.lin.summary) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 1550), breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 80), linetype = 'dashed', size = .33, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 90), linetype = 'dashed', size = .33, alpha = .25) +\n  geom_path(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`,\n                group = `Effect size`), size = .66) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`),\n             size = 1.5) +\n  labs(y = 'Power to detect a non-zero effect',\n       x = 'Number of participants per condition (control group not included)') +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#c10d0d', '#7dc3c2', '#dcc55b')) +\n  facet_wrap(~interval) +\n  theme(\n    aspect.ratio = 1,\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"white\", size = 0.33),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = \"white\", size = 0.2),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey96\"),\n    axis.line = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.375),\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = 'black', size = 0.5),\n    text = element_text(color = 'black', family = 'Gill Sans MT', size = 9),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = 'black', family = 'Gill Sans MT', size = 7),\n    strip.background = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Assess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results.\nIn Step 4, we use the information we have generated above to make substantive conclusions about the projected power of our experiment to detect certain effects, given certain underlying parameters. From this we can make recommendations as to experimental design.\nBased on the power curve plotted above, we can conclude that we would have a very high likelihood of detecting effects of .4 vs. a control group at even quite low sample sizes, and also a good possibility of detecting effect sizes of .2 at quite modest sample sizes. On the other hand, for the very small effect size, we would not be confident in detecting such a difference vs. a control group even at 1500 participants per group. If effect sizes of this size we what was expected in such an experiment, and it was crucial that they were detected if present, then we might consider going back to Step 1 and reconsidering our experimental design to include even more participants."

This model should not include ‘leaks’, i.e., it should excluding individual characteristics and outcomes that occur after the time we would be ‘doing the prediction’.\nCausal: Consider identification of ‘causal paths’, i.e., ‘what actually determines amounts donated’.1\n\n\n\nBootstrapped p-values are about uncertainty over the specific sample of the population you drew, while randomization inference p-values are about uncertainty over which units within your sample are assigned to the treatment.\n\nThe infer package vignette gives a good walk-through; this package is useful for doing these tests (some also recommend the coin package).2\n\nWe use this, and give some explanation, in the 2021 EAS donations post - see bookdown (see folds within)\n\nWe use permutation tests for testing whether the median (and mean) of planned donations exceeded/fell short of the mean for actual donations, but using the data from different years’ surveys (without connected individuals). …\n\nThe code we use for these tests is permalinked here E\nWhy use these techniques?\n\nTractable for testing differences in medians\nFairly easy to explain, fairly intuitive\nDo not depend on strong assumptions about underlying distributions or ‘large sample asymptotics’\nSome statisticians and Econometricians (e.g., Athey and Imbens) argue for their value and robustness; it also seems close to what a lot of ‘data science’ people do (they love simulation)\n\n\nDR concerns about ‘population vs super-population’, possibly misinformed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n… we nearly always want to make inferences about the population that the treatment and control groups are taken from (even thinking about a hypothetical super-population), not about the impact on the sampled groups themselves.

    "text": "9.1 Equivalence tests and simple frequentist approaches\nFrom Wikipedia (accessed 12 Apr 2022)\n\nIn equivalence tests, the null hypothesis is defined as an effect large enough to be deemed interesting, specified by an equivalence bound. The alternative hypothesis is any effect that is less extreme than said equivalence bound. The observed data is statistically compared against the equivalence bounds. If the statistical test indicates the observed data is surprising, assuming that true effects are at least as extreme as the equivalence bounds, a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences can be used to reject effect sizes larger than the equivalence bounds with a pre-specified Type 1 error rate.\n\n\nSeveral tests exist for equivalence analyses; however, more recently the Two-one-sided t-tests (TOST) procedure has been garnering considerable attention. As outlined below, this approach is an adaptation of the widely known t-test.\n\n\n“A very simple equivalence testing approach is the ‘two-one-sided t-tests’ (TOST) procedure. [Schuirmann, 1987] In the TOST procedure an upper (\\(\\Delta U\\)) and lower (-\\(\\Delta L\\)) equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest (e.g., a positive or negative difference of \\(d = 0.3\\)). Two composite null hypotheses are tested: \\(H_{01}: \\Delta \\leq –\\Delta L\\) and \\(H_{02}: \\Delta \\geq \\Delta U\\) When both these one-sided tests can be statistically rejected, we can conclude that \\(–\\Delta L < \\Delta < \\Delta U\\), or that the observed effect falls within the equivalence bounds … .[Searman et al, 1998]” [Lakens 2017]\n\nLakens offers pointers, and TOSTER package, for this approach.\nSemi-aside: Unresolved discussion of ‘Bayes factors’ (Nik and Reinstein)"

I (DR) try to implement and demonstrate this in eamt_data_analysis/oftw_giving_season_upsell_2021_trial/oftw_upsell_input_first_analysis.Rmd\nNote: there may be good ways to hijack all sorts of existing tools, such as the bayesAB package or BayesianFirstAid\n\n\nSuppose we see a ‘small difference’ between treatment groups and it is ‘not significant in standard tests’ (tests not shown here yet).\nHow can we: - Put meaningful bounds on this? - Statistically ‘rule out large effects’? - Do this in the same context as our ‘null hypothesis tests’? - Do and communicate this in a way that is acceptable to a range of audiences?\n(This parallels the analysis done in HERE, which includes dome further explanation of the methods)\n\nI (David) propose taking the following approach:\n\nConstruct (by simulation or analytical formulae) the ‘probability of “some function of our data” given a range of true parameters, i.e., given a range of relevant ’true rates of (relative) incidence’ under each treatment (1/2, 3/4, equal, 4/3, 2, etc). This includes (and perhaps focuses on) the case where ‘the true rates of incidence are equal to one another and equal to the average empirical incidence in our sample.’\n\nWhat “function of our data”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact proportional difference in incidence rates that we see\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see (in absolute value) or larger (I believe this is the ‘two-tailed frequentist p-value’)\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see (in absolute value) or smaller (this gives us a sense of ‘how unlikely is a large true effect … can we probabilistically rule out a big difference’)\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large or larger in favor of the Treatment\nA proportional difference in incidence rates as large as we see in favor of the Control\n… Perhaps similar measures for other statistics such as ‘difference in counts (not proportional), or ’average amount (donated)’ (for the latter, we’d need to consider distinct true distributions of contributions)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the above over the parameter range to get a visual picture of the maximum likelihood parameter, and (eyeballing) the relative probability of different ranges\nFor a few important elements of the above, consider the ‘relative likelihood of the data’ under different true rates of incidence (or distributions of donations), for important comparisons such as\n\n\nA relative incidence of 1.5 versus a relative incidence of 1\n\n… If the ratio is very small we might suspect that ’no difference is far more likely than a strong difference in favor of the treatment.\n\nImplicitly considering a ‘flat prior’, integrate (average) and compare important ranges of the above\n\nE.g….\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe probability mass of the parameter ‘the incidence is 1.25x or higher in favor of the Treatment’ , versus 1.25x or lower (closer to zero, or higher incidence under the Control)…\n… If the ratio is very small, then, given a fairly flat prior, our posterior should put a low probability on ‘a large difference in favor of the treatment’ …\nAnd similarly, reversing the control and treatment\nAnd similarly, for both extremes relative to a middle incidence range…\n… here, if the ratio is very small, we will say “we can probablistically rule out an effect of 1.5x or larger in either direction”\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie:\n“To put simply, likelihood is”the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) having generated D” and posterior is essentially “the likelihood of θ having generated D” further multiplied by the prior distribution of θ. If the prior distribution is flat (or non-informative), likelihood is exactly the same as posterior.”\nSo in essence, if you wanted, you could just put a prior distribution on the differences over which you have simulated differences, and multiply it with your likelihood. To get a proper posterior you would need a continuous distribution for the prior over the parameter space, and probably more simulations across the parameter space as well, to fill in the shape of the posterior. I guess the key difference between what you are suggesting and just running it as a Bayesian binomial regression is that your likelihood function is produced by simulation, whereas the one in the Bayesian regression would be generated through the model assumptions of the regression.\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, repeat the above with a Bayesian tool, considering more than one ‘explicit prior’.\n\nOngoing question: Do we need or want a separate prior for ‘incidence under treatment’ and ‘incidence under control’, or can our prior simply focus on the relative incidence rates?\n\nJamie suggests: Just do a Bayesian analysis and consider the posterior distribution. You can test the sensitivity to different priors."

For this model to be useful for an actual prediction problem going forward, it would need to rely on ‘ex-ante’ characteristic that were already observable at the time of a career/EtG/pledge decision.1 These might include immutable demographics, career plans, and pledges previously taken, and consider year and trend effects.\nAlthough we have these models in mind, this is not what we are doing here. We are not posing a specific ‘prediction problem’ per se. Instead we are using machine learning tools built for prediction problems to generate ‘data-driven insights’ about factors related to EA donation behavior. Here, we do not than directly specifying all of the included components of the model (features, interaction terms, etc.). Instead we provide a large set of possible ‘inputs’ and use ML techniques to train models that should predict well outside of the data they are trained on. These models should do a good job of accomplishing the task: ‘if you gave me a set of features of an EA, I should have a fairly accurate guess at what they will donate.’\nThe insights from these models should also be treated with caution. Again, they may not be deriving causal relationships. Furthermore, the parameters derived from model-fitting ML procedures are not in general unbiased or consistent, and it is difficult to derive proper confidence intervals for these parameters.\nStill, the benefit of this exercise may be considered ‘the derivation of robust and predictive relationships in the data that are mainly driven by the data itself, rather than our preconcieved ideas.’ These models may also be useful building blocks towards future predictive work."

The penalties are specifically ‘tuned’ and ‘validated’ to maximize the predictive power of the model. As these are essentially regression approaches, we can report the sign and magnitude of the coefficients used in the ‘optimally tuned’ predictive model. (However, we should be careful about interpreting these parameters, and statistical inference is challenging. See e.g., (Mullainathan2017?) for a detailed discussion.)\nThe GLMnet approach combines ‘ridge (L2 norm) and lasso (L2 norm)’, tuning the mix of each, as well as tuning the penalization parameters within each.\nBoth the sum of absolute value coefficients (L1 norm) and the summed square of these (L2 norm) ma y be penalized. Thus, these will be ‘shrunk towards zero’ relative to a comparable OLS (standard linear model) estimate. How much do we ‘charge’ for the absolute or squared sums? This is ‘tuned’, i.e., we see what combinations perform best in the cross-validation exercise.\nIn some cases (because of the L1 norm), coefficients may be dropped entirely, i.e., ‘shrunk all the way to zero’.2"

In other words, ‘how far off’ are the predictions and classifications on average, from the actual outcomes. This procedure considers the fit on randomly-drawn set-aside ‘testing data’, data that has not been used in ‘training’ (or ‘fitting’) the model.\nIn the vignette here we consider and discuss the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE) metrics in the context of predicting donatino outcomes.\nIn order to assess the usefulness of each predictive regression model we consider both root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE). RMSE (aka RMSD) can be interpreted as the average ‘Euclidean distance’ between the actual values and the model’s prediction. For each observation (in the set-aside ‘testing sample’), to construct RMSE we:\n\nMeasure the differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation)\nSquare these differences\nTake the average of these squared differences across all observations\nTake the square root of this\n\nTo construct mean-absolute-error (MAE) we simply\n\nMeasure the absolute-value differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation) for each observation\nTake the average of these across all observations\n\nMAE has a much more straightforward interpretation: it simply asks ‘how far off are we, on average?’\nWhile the RMSE is used in the model fitting for various reasons, it is arguably less-interpretable and less-relevant than MAE in judging the model’s fit in cases like this one. RMSE error negatively assesses the model fit based on squared deviations, and is thus very sensitive to ‘large mistakes’. This may be relevant where ‘large errors are much much worse than small ones’ – here, this is not so clearly the case. In the presence of data with large outlying observations, prediction will tend to be poor by this measure.\nNote that when considering models where the outcome is transformed (e.g., log(donations)) we construct the RMSE and MAE by exponentiating to generate predictions for the level outcomes, and then measure the deviations on the level scale.3"

Typically we have to make a chain of non-independent predictions rather than predict discrete, independent events.\n\nDR: this prediction problem should be distinguished from ‘time series econometrics’, see, e.g., Diebold’s text, which focuses on estimating fundamental structural parameters, and considers forms of ‘causality’.\n\nMost machine learning problems assume that the order of rows don’t matter and that each row is independent of each other. Since time series problems involve time-ordered rows where past events may influence future events, the rows are not independent and this independence assumption is violated.\nAnother key assumption of ML is that the training data is similar to the data being predicted (in this case, future data). This assumption must be true for time series as well.\n\n11.1.1 Decomposition\nYou can decompose a time series into four key parts:\n\nThe trend (T), where the mean is changing over time (e.g., sales generally keep increasing over time)\nSeasonality (S) (e.g., sales are higher in the holiday season)\nA non-seasonal cyclical (C) component (e.g., stock market follows “business cycles”). This is distinct from seasonality as seasonality has a fixed period (e.g., every November), whereas a cycle does not.\nA random component (e)\n\n\nDR: The ‘random component’ could be distinguised or described further; there are various types of ‘random’ terms … shifts, changes in trends, ‘moving average’ one-off terms, ‘autoregressive’ error terms\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Types of decomposition\nThere are two basic types of decomposition – addititive, where y = T + S + C + e and multiplicative, where y = T * S * C * e."

These are pretty easy to deal with. Note also that nonstationary series can be described as following a ‘random walk’\n\n\nBut I’m also not convinced that this should necessarily be a problem in a prediction problem. If the series is a random walk/nonstationary … we can still use that knowledge to make a decent prediction of where the outcome will be at time T+t given it’s value at time T.\n\n\n11.2.1 Converting to stationary\nWe can resolve these issues by converting a non-stationary series to a stationary series. This is done by differencing, where we look at the differences in the target over time rather than the actual target (y[t]-> y[t] - y[t-1]).\n\nDR: Most economic time series are in fact stationary after first-differencing. However, this is not guaranteed. You may still want to test for stationarity after first-differencing. (But my memory is that the whole tests for stationarity thing is a huge can of worms).\n\nWe can also handle exponential trends using techniques like log transformations."

    "text": "11.3 Handling Features\n\n11.3.1 Lags\nLagging is pretty key to time series. A lag is when you use the value from the previous series to forecast the next series. You can lag the target variable (e.g., use last month’s sales to predict next month’s sales) and/or you can lag independent variables. Lagged target variables often have strong explanatory power because the real world has delays (e.g., it takes a few weeks for marketing to transition to sales so marketing spend from three weeks ago may be more predictive than marketing spend of the same week) and causations that occur over time (e.g., sales from last year show that the store is more popular so there is more word of mouth and it is even more popular the next year).\nLagging always involves losing some data, as if you are using data from the previous month you won’t be able to use the first month in your training data (because there’s no previous month data for month -1). If you are using data from the three previous months, you won’t be able to train on the first three months. This may not be an issue though, because unlike with non-time series problems, more data in time series isn’t always better (since you might prefer to only be modeling the most recent trend).\nWe can mix lags of different lengths.\n\n\n11.3.2 Rolling Statistics\nLags aren’t the only thing we can do - we can also calculate rolling statistics, like the mean of a variable over the past 14 days.

Also can assess with the autocorrelation function (ACF), which does not control for other lags.\n\nchanging lag lengths based on data type, domain knowledge, and how quickly you think the series reacts to change (e.g., use shorter lags for stocks)\ncompare by backtesting\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Known in Advance vs. Not\nWhen we are trying to predict in the future, we run into an issue that the features we are using for prediction might also be unknown at prediction time. For example, our historical data might contain information about rainfall and how that connects to sales, but we can’t reliably know the rainfall three months in the future to predict future sales.\nHowever, some features are known in advance - like Christmas time may also have a big impact on sales and we always know exactly when Christmas will be.\nFor features that are not known in advance, we can still use them by either explicitly forecasting them, extrapolating them out using lags / rolling stats of sufficient size, or extrapolating from current values using differing forecast differences."

    "text": "12.1 Discussion: Assessing classification models and precision/recall\nBelow, I try to explain “Classification problems”, “Precision and Recall”, and ROC and ROC-AUC (machine learning validation) by analogy …\nThis loosely connects to the classification models used in the ‘EA Survey Donations post/bookdown’, particularly the consideration of model performance\nSpy-detection We have been asked to come up with a method for classifying spies based on observable characteristics of a suspect population (‘population’ in the statistical sense). For example, some of them have mustaches, some wear pointed hats, some have sinister cackles and lapdogs to a greater or less or degree, and some appear to be more wealthy than others… Let us suppose that: We have previous similar suspect populations that we know to be the same in nature (‘drawn from an identical pool’) to the future suspect populations that we will need to make these predictions for We ultimately learned with certainty which of the previous suspect populations turned out to be spies (To keep intuition and calculation simple) suppose that in these populations know that half of all of these people are spies, and half are completely innocent. (This is called ‘balanced classes’).\nWe are asked to come up with a method to use the observable characteristics to classify each individual as more or less likely to be a spy. If we are given a group of individuals’ characteristics our method needs to assign a number to each one that might be interpreted as the “likelihood this person is a spy”. For example our ‘model’ we might say “anyone with a mustache is 75% likely to be a spy, and anyone without a mustache is 25% likely to be a spy.” (If half of the population wears mustaches, this would also give us an average prediction in line with the known overall 50% spy rate.) Or, let’s make the ‘model’ a bit more complicated (but to allow ‘ordering’ predictions) … we might say … we give the probability of being a spy as\n\\(0.75 - 0.25*wtdev\\)\nif they wear a moustache and\n\\(0.25 - 0.25*wtdev\\) otherwise.\nwhere \\(wtdev\\) represents some “normalized” measure of the person’s weight relative to the average weight in the sample, We predict skinnier people are slightly more likely to be spies.\nNote that, since everyone’s weight is slightly different, this will yield a slightly different projected probability for any observed individual. Thus, our model could also be seen as a “ranking” where, for any group of individuals we are given we can order them from least likely to be a spy (the fattest clean-shaven people) to most likely to be a spy (the skinniest moustache-wearer).\nHow should we evaluate a model, in absolute terms, or against other models? This depends on how the models predictions will be used and on the cost of getting it right or wrong in either direction.\nOur model might be applied by a very soft judge (think Mr. Van Driessen from B&B) who thinks it is much worse to convict an innocent person then to set free many spies. On the other hand it might be applied by a very tight-ass judge (think the gym coach) who puts almost no cost on convicting the innocent … he just wants to cath spies. How can we conceive of the ‘success’ of our model? (edited)\n\nWe could compare across different models to see if one does ‘universally better or worse’ in a sense to be defined. Suppose each model both gives a probability of being a spy for each person. As noted, this implies that each model “rank-orders” a population of individuals in terms of most to least likely being a spy.\n\n\nIn a given (test) set of data, we might see something like the number line dots thing above. The person our model claims is most likely to be a spy is on the right and the one predicted least likely is on the left. In application the liberal judge (“vDriessen”) might convict only the “top 1/3” of the distribution, while the tight-ass (“Coach”) might put 2/3 of these ‘dots’ in prison. Each have made different types of mistakes in practice. vDriessen let a bunch of spies free (and falsely convicted only a few), while the Coach put a lot of innocent people in prison (and, in practice, but not in the dots example above, also let a few spies free). (edited)\nWe might consider that our model has some probability of being applied by various types of judges. It might be that our model performs “better” than an alternative model when applied by the liberal vDriessen but “worse” when applied by the strict Coach. On the other hand, we can imagine that some models might perform better for nearly all types of judge! How could we measure this? The ROC curve can be helpful:\n\nAbove we see models that are strictly ordered from best to worse … the lines do not cross (this need not always be the case). The blue line to picks or model that is strictly better than the orange line, which is itself strictly better than a “random classifier”. A ‘random classifier’ give us no information. If we use this we can only choose some probability to convict everyone. Using this, if we increase the rate we can convict people by 2 per 100, then on average we are convicting one more spy and one more innocent person, in our example. So, by what measure is the blue classifier ‘better’ than the orange one (and both are better than the random classifier)? (edited)\nRemember, each classifier gives a ‘ranked ordering’ of the population. Suppose that we consider going down the list from the most guilty looking to the most innocent looking, and increasing the number of people that we choose to convict.\nAs we go down the ranking in general and decide to convict a larger share of the population we are adding some possibility of convicting and innocent person (the ‘cost’) to gain the ‘benefit’ of convicting some true spies. As depicted in the ROC curves above, as we do this the blue curve (classifier) is achieving a better tradeoff than the orange, green or red curve … (this is because it gives us a ‘better ordered list of who us more likely to be guilty’)…\nAs the judge using the blue curve decides to go further down the ‘blue curve list’ (paying the cost of convicting more innocent people) he also catches more spies than if he had used the ‘orange, green, or red curve list’ . The benefit to cost ratio is higher at all ‘rates of conviction’ here. (edited)\nThis is fine in a relative sense … we know blue is better here (better than all the others except for the purple ‘perfect classifier’ … which is equivalent to a tool that always ‘perfectly orders’ guilt so there is no tradeoff)\nBut:\n\nWhat if the curves cross? and\nHow do we consider the “overall” success of these classifier models? Maybe they are all doing a terrible job.\n\n(gotta run now, will try to get back to this … for question 2 the ‘area under the curve’ seems like a decent measure that somehow ‘averages’ the gain in insight over the random classifier for all possible types of judge, if I understand correctly)\nI have been told that the following is the case:\n\nGiven randomly chosen examples from class 1 and 2, the AUC is the probability that our classifier gives a larger probability of assigning the class 1 example to class 1 (true positive) than the class 2 example (false positive)\n\nI am reinterpreting this more simply as…\n\nCompare a randomly chosen spy (case \\(i\\) where \\(y_i=1\\)) to a randomly chosen innocent person (case \\(i\\) where \\(y_i=0\\)) … (in the testing data). Recall that a ‘classifier’ (at least typically, e.g., as in a logistic regression) assigns to each case \\(i\\) some probability \\(\\hat(p_i)\\) of being a spy, based on its features. The AUC tells me “the probability that my classifier assigns a larger probability of guilt \\(\\hat(p_i)\\) to the randomly-chosen spy than to the randomly-chosen innocent person.”\n\nAn analogy has also been made to the Wilcoxon Rank-sum measure."

(Todo– integrate the data here.)\nWe know some emails are repeated. To analyze this correctly I should bring in the actual distribution of ‘number of times an email is in the data’ and simulate assignment. (Or maybe this is a ‘Poisson’ thing?)\nAs a (perhaps incorrect) first pass I could consider ‘legitimate unique email shows up in the treatment group’ as a random binomial event.

    "text": "16.4 How likely are ‘proportions this similar’ under different size ‘true effect sizes’?1\n\nIn the next section I started an off-the-cuff simulation approach, in folded code. But I believe that the analytical form here with code and a simulation here should be applicable.\n\n16.4.1 Difference between two binomial random variables.\nReprinting and discussing from Stackexchange post\n“derive the distribution of the difference between two binomial random variables.”\n\nI can give you an answer for the pmf of X-Y. From there |X - Y| is straightforward.\n\n\nSo we start with\n\\(X \\sim Bin(n_1, p_1)\\)\n\\(Y \\sim Bin(n_2, p_2)\\)\nWe are looking for the probability mass function of \\(Z=X-Y\\)\n\nNote: in our case we (arguably) care about the difference in ‘proportion of incidences’, but as we also have similar sample sizes (\\(n_1 \\approx n_2\\)) this is basically a normalization\n\nFirst note that the min and max of the support of Z must be \\((-n_2, n_1)\\) since that covers the most extreme cases (\\(X=0\\) and \\(Y=n_2\\)) and (\\(X=n_1\\) and \\(Y=0\\)).\nThen we need a modification of the binomial pmf so that it can cope with values outside of its support.\n\\(m(k, n, p) = \\binom {n} {k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\) when \\(k \\leq n\\) and 0 otherwise.\n\nNote that this “modified binomial” is what the statistics::dbinom function in R returns.\n\nThen we need to define two cases\n\n\\(Z \\geq 0\\)\n\\(Z \\lt 0\\)\n\nIn the first case\n\\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2)\\)\nsince this covers all the ways in which X-Y could equal z.\n\nBecause \\((i+z) - i = z\\), of course … ‘sum up’ the probability of each of these ‘co-occurances’\n\nFor example when z=1 this is reached when X=1 and Y=0 and X=2 and Y=1 and X=3 and Y=4 and so on. It also deals with cases that could not happen because of the values of \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). For example if \\(n_2 = 4\\) then we cannot get Z=1 as a combination of X=4 and Y=5. In this case thanks to our modified binomial pmf the probablity is zero.\nFor the second case we just reverse the roles. For example if z=-1 then this is reached when X=0 and Y=1, X=1 and Y=2 etc.\n\\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2)\\)\nPut them together and that’s your pmf.\n\n\\(f(z)=\\)\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n    \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2),& \\text{if } z\\geq 0\\\\\n    \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2),              & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nHere’s the function in R and a simulation to check it’s right (and it does work.) https://gist.github.com/ragscripts/9681819\n\nLet me try to apply it…\nDefining their code for this function: ::: {.cell}\nCodemodBin <-dbinom #DR: I just do this renaming here for consistency with the rest ... but the modBin they defined was redundant\n\ndiffBin<-function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){\n\n  prob <- 0\n\n  if (z>=0){\n    for (i in 1:n1){\n      prob <- prob + modBin(i+z, n1, p1) * modBin(i, n2, p2)\n    }\n\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    for (i in 1:n2){\n      prob<-prob+modBin(i+z, n1, p1)*modBin(i, n2, p2)\n    }\n  }\n  return(prob)\n}\n:::\n\n16.4.2 Applying this to present data\nRather than using their example, I’ll dive right in to the present case.\nMy notes on the outcomes as of 15 Dec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment 1 - Impact and Treatment 2 - Emotion Story tabs\nTreatment 1: We record - 8 unique emails donating, 26 donations in total, - worth 5200 USD in total - 1345 unique emails listed as getting ‘control’ treatment 1\nTreatment 2: - 6 unique emails, 28 donations so far — worth 7500 USD in total. - 1190 unique emails listed for treatment 2\nIf I believe my ‘unique emails count’, that implies an 0.59% ‘conversion’ rate for T1 - Control a 0.50% conversion rate for T2 - Emotion/Story\n\n\n\nPutting the observations into defined objects (later: do from data)\n\nCoden1 <- 1345\nn2 <- 1190\nd1 <- 8\nd2 <- 6\nz <- d1-d2\n\n\nComputation for a few ‘ad-hoc cases’ (later explore the space with vectors of values)\n\nSuppose truly equal incidence, at the mean level\n\n\nCodep1 <- (d1+d2)/(n1+n2)\n\np2 <- p1\n\n(\n  db_0 <- diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n)\n\n[1] 0.1024599\n\n\nThis implies there is a 10.2% chance of getting this exact difference of +2 incidences between the treatments (in one direction), if the true incidence rates were equal.\nLet’s plot this for a range of ‘incidence rate differences’ in this region. (Sorry, using the traditional plot, ggplot is better).\n\nCodes <- seq(-10*z, 10*z)\np<-sapply(s, function(z) diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2))\nplot(s,p)\n\n\n\n\nWe see a large likelihood of values in the range of the +2 difference observed, and a low likelihood of a difference of 10 or more in either direction.\n\n16.4.3 Adaptation: ‘of this magnitude or smaller’\n\nCodeltmag_diffBin <- function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){\n  prob <- 0\n  z_n <- -z #negative value\n\n  for (i in z_n:z){     #sum for all integer differences between observed value and its negative, inclusive\n    prob <- prob + diffBin(i, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n    }\n\n  return(prob)\n}\n\n\nNow, a similar computation as above, but for ‘this big or smaller in magnitude’:\n\nCode  (\n    mag_db_0 <- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n  )\n\n[1] 0.4908031\n\n\nThis implies there is a 49.1% chance of getting a difference no larger than this one in magnitude of +/-2 incidences between the treatments if the true incidence rates were equal.\n\nAnd finally, what we were looking for: the chance of ‘a difference this small or smaller’ as a function of the true difference…\nSet up an arbitrary vector of ‘true differences’ (to keep it simple, only change it in one direction for now …)\nBelow, I plot\nY-axis: ’how likely would a difference in donations ‘as small or smaller in magnitude’” than we see in the data against\nX-axis: if the “true difference in incidence rates” were of these magnitudes\n\nCodeoptions(scipen=999)\n\nB <- c(1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 10)\n\np1 <- rep((d1+d2)/(n1+n2), length(B))\np2 <- p1*B\n\n\nas.list(ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)*100) %>% format(digits=3, scientific=FALSE)\n\n[1] \"49.1\"             \"39.4\"             \"20.6\"             \"8.02\"            \n[5] \"2.51\"             \"0.153\"            \"0.00000000000855\"\n\nCodeprobmag <- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)\n\n\n#qplot(B, probmag, log  = \"x\", xlab = \"True relative incidence\", ylab =\"Prob. of difference this small\")\n\n(\n  probmag_plot <-\n    ggplot() +\n  aes(x=B, y=probmag) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +\n    ylim(0,.51) +\n    xlab(\"True relative incidence rate\") +\n    ylab(\"Prob. diff. as small as obsd\")\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nHard-coded takeaways 15 Dec 2021 :\nOur data is consistent with ‘no difference’ (of course) … but its also consistent with ‘a fairly large difference in incidence’\nE.g., even if one treatment truly lead to ‘twice as many donations as the other’, we still have a 20% chance of seeing a differences as small as the one we see (of 8 versus 6)\nWe can reasonably ‘rule out’ differences of maybe 2.5x or greater\nMain point: given the rareness of donations in this context, our sample size doesn’t let us make very strong conclusions in either directions … at least not yet. I hope that combined with other evidence, we will be able to infer more"
