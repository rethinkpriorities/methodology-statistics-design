Please be careful not to share any confidential data or sensitive information. 1.1 Rethink Priorities: Our approach to empirical and quantitative work 1.2 The purpose of this resource A github-hosted ‘bookdown’ for structured in-depth discussion David Reinstein’s conception: Don’t share any confidential data or sensitive information Don’t feel compelled to flesh out all sections with original content. Don’t add content just because “it’s in a typical syllabus’. Focus on things that we use, have used, want to use, or have been requested to address. Secondarily, on things relevant to Effective Altruism-related research in general Do curate link, and embed resources from elsewhere Incorporate examples from our work (where these are not sensitive or they where can be made anonymous) Do put in content that is more in-depth and technical, or involving R-code and tools Still, do try to ‘offset’ details (in folding blocks, appendix sections, margin notes), where it would otherwise clutter the book Start with ‘plain language’ explanations of technical content; for ourselves, and potentially to share with partners in future I also hope to use this to develop ‘templates and standard practices’ for our work. What to include and when to dive into the rabbit hole? (Unfold: the ‘second time it comes up’ rule) In ‘building a knowledge base’, there are some things that are important to include, but others should be excluded. If we are compulsive and auto-nerd-sniped to go down every rabbit hole it will be wasteful. But some rabbit holes will be worth going down, at least partially. What’s a good rule-of-thumb for knowing if it’s worth a dive? Maybe the ‘second time rule’? Mark the issue the first time it comes up, perhaps leave a placeholder and a link to the original notes or discussion. Then the second time an issue comes up it may be safe to assume its an ‘important issue to dive into and document’? Below, ‘a partial dive into the rabbit hole’, for one possible framework. What do I mean by a ‘partial dive into the rabbit hole?’ Explain how it applied to our problem (generically if there is a confidentiality issue) Curated links PeteW-gists-eqsue, characterize in our own words (but concisely) give a code example in a ‘vignette’, check our understanding through communication and discussion with others, flag key issues 1.3 Sections and organization (Proposed/discussed below – keep updated with actual structure) DATA, CODE * * Note that the capital letters denote the highest-level sections, but in the markdown these are at the same level as the sections below Coding practice and tools (Languages, clean code, reproducability, etc.) Data practices (Storing, labeling, etc) PRESENTING AND DESCRIBING DATA Methods of ‘describing data’ Formatting: tables, figures, and numerical content** Visualizations: suggested/preferred formats and templates SURVEY DESIGNS AND METHODS How to ask good survey questions Avoiding pitfalls Sampling issues and representativeness Constructing reliable indices and scales Implementation platforms and issues Survey design tools (IT) **EXPERIMENTS AND TRIALS* Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines Experiment and trial design: quantitative issues ‘Treatment’ assignment (blocking, randomization, etc) Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design Power analyses (and other ‘diagnosands’) BASIC STATISTICS: MODELING, TESTING AND INFERENCE Bayesian, frequentist, and other approaches A ‘statistical model’* * I put in the first discussion of ‘models’ here because, at least in one perspective, all of the below is based on models.

For some previous posts, we pasted from the Rstudio visual mode pastes into Google docs for narrative, and figures/tables could be manually pasted. But we want to avoid having to do that! David Reinstein has worked with Pete and others on tools to (mostly) automate this conversion and hosting process, but some manual tweaks were needed at the end. See the work on this here, at bottom, and in this R script and this Python script. Yes, spaghetti code. Atm, some formatting adjustments are necessary, e.g., EA Forum doesn’t have margin notes or folding boxes. 3.2 Visualisations See also Gdoc: visualisation discussions Ideal coding practice for visualisations Use ggplot always unless you’ve a strong reason to do otherwise. Always save the plot as an object in the environment as well as printing it where it belongs. Ideally, we will come up with a set of functions and default options for the key sets of plots we use and like. Define and reuse lists of labels (or use inherent labeling options where these exist, to exploit existing variable and value labels.) Otherwise define sets of common options for plots in one place, and repeated ggplot elements together as a list: to avoid repetition and clutter to allow easy ‘global’ adjustment Labeling Use readable but concise labels. “Amount donated” is OK, “GWWC” is OK because we assume people know what GWWC is from context. amt_don is not OK. Pete will yell at you. Try to have labels be automated … either using column attributes or a concise list Case: Relative shares of a total; e.g. ‘shares of EA population by referrer’, or ‘donation totals by country’ Treemaps NOTE: The below will not run without data, but we cannot make data ‘public’ here … we can swap this for built in R or simulated data in this discussion geom_treemap_opts &lt;- list(geom_treemap(alpha = 0.7), geom_treemap_text(fontface = &quot;italic&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;, place = &quot;centre&quot;, grow = TRUE, min.size = 1 ), theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;, plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) ) ## Error in geom_treemap(alpha = 0.7): could not find function &quot;geom_treemap&quot; ( don_share_by_size &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% select(donation_2019_c, donation_2019_c_split) %&gt;% group_by(donation_2019_c_split) %&gt;% summarise(total_don = sum(donation_2019_c, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% mutate(don_share = round(total_don/sum(total_don)*100)) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(donation_2019_c_split)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(area = total_don, fill= donation_2019_c_split, # Include percentage of total donation label = paste(donation_2019_c_split, paste0(don_share, &quot;%&quot;), sep = &quot;\\n&quot;))) + geom_treemap_opts + ggtitle(&quot;Share of total 2019 reported donation amount, by donation size&quot;) ) ## Error in eas_20 %&gt;% select(donation_2019_c, donation_2019_c_split) %&gt;% : could not find function &quot;%&gt;%&quot; A good alternative to the treemap … conveying both absolute amounts and rates in the same graph?

But what if we have a few values that are way above others, and ‘mess up the scale’? Sometimes a logarithmic scale is helpful, but that can also lead to confusion. Otherwise… “any CI’s or other things that go outside of the limits should just be extended to the edge and not dropped)” doable with scale_y_continuous( oob = scales::squish) + scale_x_continuous( oob = scales::squish)or `coord_cartesian` or otherwise allow a clear ‘break’ in the axis? Not possible to break the axis ggplot https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7194688/using-ggplot2-can-i-insert-a-break-in-the-axis (Oska?) – what about ‘extending to the edge’? Remove outliers as a last resort; prominently mention this where doing so.

Here, I think the use of %&gt;% ggplotly yields only one helpful feature (but its very helpful): hovering over a dot or point on the line brings up an exact value label. I think this helps a reader understand ‘what the heck this is’.

This can lead to setups that appear strange or artificial, which itself might bring responses it will not be representative or generalizable. {% hint style=“info” %} For example, in my ‘give if you win’ (lab) work we had a trial that was (paraphrasing) ‘we are asking you to commit to a donation that may or may not be collected. If the coin flips heads, we will collect the amount you commit, otherwise no donation is made’. It was meant to separate the component of the “give if you win effect” driven by the uncertain nature of the commitment rather than the uncertain nature of the income. However when we considered bringing this to field experiments, there was no way to do it without it making it obvious that this was an experiment or a very strange exercise. {% endhint %} When we consider an experiment providing ‘real impact information’ to potential donors, we might be encouraged to use the exact write-up from Givewell’s page, for naturalness. However, this may not present the “lives per dollar” information in exactly the same way between two charities of interest, and the particular write-up may suggest certain “anchors” (e.g., whole numbers that people may want to contribute). Thus if we use the exact GW language we may not be 100% confident that the provision of the impact of information is driving any difference. We might be tempted to change it; but at a possible cost of naturalness and direct applicability. There are very often tradeoffs of this sort. 6.5 Awareness of testing can affect results In the present context, we have posted about our work, in general terms, on a public forum (EA forum post). Thus the idea that ‘people are running experiments to promote effective giving and EA ideas’ is not a well-kept secret. If participants in our experiments and trials are aware of this it may affect their choices and responses to treatments. This general set of problem is referred to in various ways, referring to different aspects of this; see ‘experimenter demand’, ‘desirability bias’, ‘arbitrary coherence/coherent arbitrariness’, observer bias (?), etc. Mitigating this, in our context, most of our experiments will be conducted in subtle ways (e.g., small but meaningful variations in EA-aligned home pages), and individuals will only see one of these (with variation by geography or by IP-linked cookies). Furthermore, we will conduct most of our experiments targeting non-EA-aligned audiences unlikely to read posts like this one.

The infer package vignette gives a good walk-through; this package is useful for doing these tests (some also recommend the coin package).* * See also Reinstein’s notes/work on the vignette. We use this, and give some explanation, in the 2021 EAS donations post - see bookdown (see folds within) We use permutation tests for testing whether the median (and mean) of planned donations exceeded/fell short of the mean for actual donations, but using the data from different years’ surveys (without connected individuals). … The code we use for these tests is permalinked here E Why use these techniques? Tractable for testing differences in medians Fairly easy to explain, fairly intuitive Do not depend on strong assumptions about underlying distributions or ‘large sample asymptotics’ Some statisticians and Econometricians (e.g., Athey and Imbens) argue for their value and robustness; it also seems close to what a lot of ‘data science’ people do (they love simulation) DR concerns about ‘population vs super-population’, possibly misinformed: … we nearly always want to make inferences about the population that the treatment and control groups are taken from (even thinking about a hypothetical super-population), not about the impact on the sampled groups themselves. So, with this in mind, when would I still want to use randomization inference. 7.4 Particular ‘experimetrics’ issues Should we include controls (covariates) in analyzing ‘treatment effects’ from randomized experiments? “in the conventional sampling paradigm… Controlling for observable heterogeneity using a regression model” is required for the assumptions to be justified with this approach. With the randomisation approach it makes more sense to put data into strata by covariates, analyse within-group experiments and average results.” - (?)

We want to model this in a way that allows for overall trends (possibly nonlinear(, seasonality, and possibly autocorrelation (AR and MA terms?).* * Do we need to test for stationarity (and then difference and test it again?) … and maybe also ‘structural breaks’. When considering the impact of an event, we/they want to measure its ‘full effect over time’, taking into account its lagged effects, and possibly indirect ‘autoregressive effects’ (as converted people may bring in additional converts, etc.) DR: I think we need the partner to clarify their goals a bit more. Is it: 1. Predict the evolution in the future to aid their planning?, 2. Understand the value of specific types of media coverage and other things they might influence?, 3. Or just to the specifically mentioned event? 4. Understand how the outcomes reacted to things largely out of their control? DR: I think a simple model ‘adjusted to trends (and maybe seasonality)’ might be good enough as a first pass. I’m not sure the data is rich enough to justify much more. 9.1.3 Nik’s approach so I don’t have a huge amount of familiarity here :confused: but from past cursory reads of the lit my impression’s been that there are lots of equivalencies to areas I’m more familiar with, e.g. an ARIMA(0,1,0) model is a Brownian motion is a GP with Gaussian kernel \\(min(x_1,x_2)\\) so from your description of them problem, there are a few salient properties / complexities: The focal outcome is a discrete nonzero number, ie the number of apps / page views. The focal parameter is something like being featured in the WSJ, i.e. a (0,1) indicator. Maybe the effect of this isn’t one-and-done, but but gives an immediate boost that e.g. decays exponentially through time? The data are temporally autocorrelated, i.e. samples closer together in time are probably going to be more similar to each other than those further away There may also be a linear trend through time separate from being featured in the WSJ, e.g. increasing general interest in 80kh, such that average interest on either side of the ‘discontinuity’ is different in a manner unrelated to 2. There may also be nonlinear trends through time, e.g. seasonality effects. I think my first stab would be to model this with a GLM Specifically, a Poisson likelihood w/ a log link and linear model with intercept, (DR: Poisson because its ‘arrival of events’. Why a ‘log link’?) a linear coefficient on time, and an indicator for some discrete bump corresponding to whether a point came before or after the WSJ feature. (DR: Fundamentally, there will be bumps in individual periods that may occur randomly. A shock or permanent shift after the WSJ feature need not have been caused by it. The question is ‘how unusual is such a shock, in the context of a long time series of shocks’? And how long is this series, anyways?) Then, add a mean 0 multivariate normal error term for overdispersion to this, composing like an RBF kernel w/ a periodic kernel? (DR: Can you explain more? And does this allow for flexible autocorrelation? Do we need to ‘test if its a random walk’?) This would sorta be like ‘kriging’ / using GPs to model temporal autocorrelation and I think should satisfy 1-3 above. And then if that works focus on trying to build out to cover more nuanced dynamics. But there might be better / more established ways to treat problems like this! (I don’t know what ‘kriging’ means; does anyone else understand it?) 9.1.4 Kim C’s thoughts structural change analysis (e.g., like that implemented in the R package strucchange). You can use this procedure to find “breakpoints” in the data where for example, is the slope changes value. If you think the trends are nonlinear, I’ve done a similar thing using GAMs, and then taking the 1st derivative of the fitted curves and checking if it intersects zero. Explained pretty well here. 9.2 PETE’S NOTES BELOW DR: Not sure what/how to adapt this In Machine Learning, Time series problems are problems that involve forecasting (extrapolating) the future based on the information of the past. Typically we have to make a chain of non-independent predictions rather than predict discrete, independent events. DR: this prediction problem should be distinguished from ‘time series econometrics’, see, e.g., Diebold’s text, which focuses on estimating fundamental structural parameters, and considers forms of ‘causality’. Most machine learning problems assume that the order of rows don’t matter and that each row is independent of each other. Since time series problems involve time-ordered rows where past events may influence future events, the rows are not independent and this independence assumption is violated. Another key assumption of ML is that the training data is similar to the data being predicted (in this case, future data). This assumption must be true for time series as well. 9.2.1 Decomposition You can decompose a time series into four key parts: The trend (T), where the mean is changing over time (e.g., sales generally keep increasing over time) Seasonality (S) (e.g., sales are higher in the holiday season) A non-seasonal cyclical (C) component (e.g., stock market follows “business cycles”). This is distinct from seasonality as seasonality has a fixed period (e.g., every November), whereas a cycle does not. A random component (e) DR: The ‘random component’ could be distinguised or described further; there are various types of ‘random’ terms … shifts, changes in trends, ‘moving average’ one-off terms, ‘autoregressive’ error terms 9.2.2 Types of decomposition There are two basic types of decomposition – addititive, where y = T + S + C + e and multiplicative, where y = T * S * C * e. 9.3 Stationary vs. non-stationarity Stationary time series (a) do not have a trend and also (b) do not have variance that changes over time. Non-stationary time series’ do have (a) and/or (b). Typically (a) and (b) create problems for modeling, as models have trouble extrapolating these and they tend to violate the assumption that the training data is similar to the data being predicted. DR: There can be trend-stationary series, that are stationary after including a trend. These are pretty easy to deal with. Note also that nonstationary series can be described as following a ‘random walk’ But I’m also not convinced that this should necessarily be a problem in a prediction problem. If the series is a random walk/nonstationary … we can still use that knowledge to make a decent prediction of where the outcome will be at time T+t given it’s value at time T. 9.3.1 Converting to stationary We can resolve these issues by converting a non-stationary series to a stationary series. This is done by differencing, where we look at the differences in the target over time rather than the actual target (y[t]-&gt; y[t] - y[t-1]). DR: Most economic time series are in fact stationary after first-differencing. However, this is not guaranteed. You may still want to test for stationarity after first-differencing. (But my memory is that the whole tests for stationarity thing is a huge can of worms). We can also handle exponential trends using techniques like log transformations. 9.4 Handling Features 9.4.1 Lags Lagging is pretty key to time series. A lag is when you use the value from the previous series to forecast the next series. You can lag the target variable (e.g., use last month’s sales to predict next month’s sales) and/or you can lag independent variables. Lagged target variables often have strong explanatory power because the real world has delays (e.g., it takes a few weeks for marketing to transition to sales so marketing spend from three weeks ago may be more predictive than marketing spend of the same week) and causations that occur over time (e.g., sales from last year show that the store is more popular so there is more word of mouth and it is even more popular the next year). Lagging always involves losing some data, as if you are using data from the previous month you won’t be able to use the first month in your training data (because there’s no previous month data for month -1). If you are using data from the three previous months, you won’t be able to train on the first three months. This may not be an issue though, because unlike with non-time series problems, more data in time series isn’t always better (since you might prefer to only be modeling the most recent trend). We can mix lags of different lengths. 9.4.2 Rolling Statistics Lags aren’t the only thing we can do - we can also calculate rolling statistics, like the mean of a variable over the past 14 days. You can also do rolling stats on differences. 9.4.3 Which Lags / Rolling Stats to Use? Assess with cross correlation function, which tests correlation of many different lags. ooAssess with partial autocorrelation function (PACF), which gives the partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own lagged values, regressed the values of the time series at all shorter lags. Also can assess with the autocorrelation function (ACF), which does not control for other lags. changing lag lengths based on data type, domain knowledge, and how quickly you think the series reacts to change (e.g., use shorter lags for stocks) compare by backtesting 9.4.4 Known in Advance vs. Not When we are trying to predict in the future, we run into an issue that the features we are using for prediction might also be unknown at prediction time. For example, our historical data might contain information about rainfall and how that connects to sales, but we can’t reliably know the rainfall three months in the future to predict future sales. However, some features are known in advance - like Christmas time may also have a big impact on sales and we always know exactly when Christmas will be. For features that are not known in advance, we can still use them by either explicitly forecasting them, extrapolating them out using lags / rolling stats of sufficient size, or extrapolating from current values using differing forecast differences. 9.5 Validation Normally for ML problems we use cross validation, where we randomly partition the data and then predict one partition using data from all the other partitions. The problem with this for time series is that this will involve using future data to predict the past, which will make for unrealistically good predictions. Instead, we can use backtesting where we predict a future time using a window of past times (e.g., predict Year 6 using Years 3-5, predict Year 5 using Years 2-4, predict Year 4 using Years 1-3). For metrics, it’s good to compare the evaluation metric to a naive baseline model, or an intentionally minimal extrapolation. 9.6 Types of Models Integrated model - move model one step at a time, e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing - univariate Forecast distance model - predict fixed distances, e.g., XGB Trend and decomposition model - predict a different model for each distance, e.g., FB Prophet 9.6.1 ARIMA Autoregressive process: AR(p): fit coefficients to p lags Moving average process: MA(q): fit coefficients to q previous errors ARMA model: X = f(AR, MA) I(d) = Differencing d times ARIMA(p, d, q) = AR(p) + I(d) + MA(q) 9.7 Multiseries Predict a different time series for each unit (e.g., sales by store). Can use features across series (cross series features). "],["classification-models.html", "10 Classification models 10.1 Discussion: Assesing classification models and precision/recall", " 10 Classification models (Fill in or link here) 10.1 Discussion: Assesing classification models and precision/recall Below, I try to explain “Classification problems”, “Precision and Recall”, and ROC and ROC-AUC (machine learning validation) by analogy … This loosely connects to the classification models used in the ‘EA Survey Donations post/bookdown’, particularly the consideration of model performance Spy-detection We have been asked to come up with a method for classifying spies based on observable characteristics of a suspect population (‘population’ in the statistical sense). For example, some of them have mustaches, some wear pointed hats, some have sinister cackles and lapdogs to a greater or less or degree, and some appear to be more wealthy than others… Let us suppose that: We have previous similar suspect populations that we know to be the same in nature (‘drawn from an identical pool’) to the future suspect populations that we will need to make these predictions for We ultimately learned with certainty which of the previous suspect populations turned out to be spies (To keep intuition and calculation simple) suppose that in these populations know that half of all of these people are spies, and half are completely innocent. (This is called ‘balanced classes’). We are asked to come up with a method to use the observable characteristics to classify each individual as more or less likely to be a spy. If we are given a group of individuals’ characteristics our method needs to assign a number to each one that might be interpreted as the “likelihood this person is a spy”. For example our ‘model’ we might say “anyone with a mustache is 75% likely to be a spy, and anyone without a mustache is 25% likely to be a spy.” (If half of the population wears mustaches, this would also give us an average prediction in line with the known overall 50% spy rate.) Or, let’s make the ‘model’ a bit more complicated (but to allow ‘ordering’ predictions) … we might say … we give the probability of being a spy as \\(0.75 - 0.25*wtdev\\) if they wear a moustache and \\(0.25 - 0.25*wtdev\\) otherwise. where \\(wtdev\\) represents some “normalized” measure of the person’s weight relative to the average weight in the sample, We predict skinnier people are slightly more likely to be spies. Note that, since everyone’s weight is slightly different, this will yield a slightly different projected probability for any observed individual. Thus, our model could also be seen as a “ranking” where, for any group of individuals we are given we can order them from least likely to be a spy (the fattest clean-shaven people) to most likely to be a spy (the skinniest moustache-wearer). How should we evaluate a model, in absolute terms, or against other models? This depends on how the models predictions will be used and on the cost of getting it right or wrong in either direction. Our model might be applied by a very soft judge (think Mr. Van Driessen from B&amp;B) who thinks it is much worse to convict an innocent person then to set free many spies. On the other hand it might be applied by a very tight-ass judge (think the gym coach) who puts almost no cost on convicting the innocent … he just wants to cath spies. How can we conceive of the ‘success’ of our model? (edited) We could compare across different models to see if one does ‘universally better or worse’ in a sense to be defined. Suppose each model both gives a probability of being a spy for each person. As noted, this implies that each model “rank-orders” a population of individuals in terms of most to least likely being a spy. In a given (test) set of data, we might see something like the number line dots thing above. The person our model claims is most likely to be a spy is on the right and the one predicted least likely is on the left. In application the liberal judge (“vDriessen”) might convict only the “top 1/3” of the distribution, while the tight-ass (“Coach”) might put 2/3 of these ‘dots’ in prison. Each have made different types of mistakes in practice. vDriessen let a bunch of spies free (and falsely convicted only a few), while the Coach put a lot of innocent people in prison (and, in practice, but not in the dots example above, also let a few spies free). (edited) We might consider that our model has some probability of being applied by various types of judges. It might be that our model performs “better” than an alternative model when applied by the liberal vDriessen but “worse” when applied by the strict Coach. On the other hand, we can imagine that some models might perform better for nearly all types of judge! How could we measure this? The ROC curve can be helpful: Above we see models that are strictly ordered from best to worse … the lines do not cross (this need not always be the case). The blue line to picks or model that is strictly better than the orange line, which is itself strictly better than a “random classifier”. A ‘random classifier’ give us no information. If we use this we can only choose some probability to convict everyone. Using this, if we increase the rate we can convict people by 2 per 100, then on average we are convicting one more spy and one more innocent person, in our example. So, by what measure is the blue classifier ‘better’ than the orange one (and both are better than the random classifier)? (edited) Remember, each classifier gives a ‘ranked ordering’ of the population. Suppose that we consider going down the list from the most guilty looking to the most innocent looking, and increasing the number of people that we choose to convict. As we go down the ranking in general and decide to convict a larger share of the population we are adding some possibility of convicting and innocent person (the ‘cost’) to gain the ‘benefit’ of convicting some true spies. As depicted in the ROC curves above, as we do this the blue curve (classifier) is achieving a better tradeoff than the orange, green or red curve … (this is because it gives us a ‘better ordered list of who us more likely to be guilty’)… As the judge using the blue curve decides to go further down the ‘blue curve list’ (paying the cost of convicting more innocent people) he also catches more spies than if he had used the ‘orange, green, or red curve list’ . The benefit to cost ratio is higher at all ‘rates of conviction’ here. (edited) This is fine in a relative sense … we know blue is better here (better than all the others except for the purple ‘perfect classifier’ … which is equivalent to a tool that always ‘perfectly orders’ guilt so there is no tradeoff) But: What if the curves cross? and How do we consider the “overall” success of these classifier models? Maybe they are all doing a terrible job. (gotta run now, will try to get back to this … for question 2 the ‘area under the curve’ seems like a decent measure that somehow ‘averages’ the gain in insight over the random classifier for all possible types of judge, if I understand correctly) I have been told that the following is the case: Given randomly chosen examples from class 1 and 2, the AUC is the probability that our classifier gives a larger probability of assigning the class 1 example to class 1 (true positive) than the class 2 example (false positive) I am reinterpreting this more simply as… Compare a randomly chosen spy (case \\(i\\) where \\(y_i=1\\)) to a randomly chosen innocent person (case \\(i\\) where \\(y_i=0\\)) … (in the testing data). Recall that a ‘classifier’ (at least typically, e.g., as in a logistic regression) assigns to each case \\(i\\) some probability \\(\\hat(p_i)\\) of being a spy, based on its features. The AUC tells me “the probability that my classifier assigns a larger probability of guilt \\(\\hat(p_i)\\) to the randomly-chosen spy than to the randomly-chosen innocent person.” An analogy has also been made to the Wilcoxon Rank-sum measure.

Although this started from a Bayesian paradigm, the overarching framework is applicable to any analytic approach, and I will begin with a standard frequentist analysis.* * This will make the code easier to run as well. Note that as Bayesian power analyses can be very time consuming (at the moment/with our current setup), in some cases even if you ultimately might perform a Bayesian analysis, it may make some sense to run frequentist approaches first. In many cases the estimates from Bayesian and frequentist approaches will tend to converge. I (Jamie) suspect general estimates from frequentist approaches would be quite similar to those of Bayesian approaches, if the goal of the analysis (what you want to make an inference about) is the same. I will make an accompanying document with an example of a Bayesian power analysis that should be computationally feasible to accompany this. The general approach laid out here can be the basis for developing and build a library of common analyses and inference goals. (DR: we might want to incorporate declaredesign for this.) Helpful future additions to the toolkit would include clear and flexible ways to generate hypothetical data sets, and adding further analytic designs. This is not intended as an exhaustive introduction to the fundamentals of statistical power - I assume you are reasonably well-versed in some general principles of statistical inference and hypothesis testing, as well as in the basic idea of what power analysis is. (DR: We can cover this in the earlier section, or link relevant expanations). We will focus solely on ‘simulation-based’ power analysis, and not on ways of mathematically (analytically) deriving power. 12.1.2 Definition of power In frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), power is typically defined as the probability that we can reject the null hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis is indeed true (i.e., power is the ‘true positive rate’).* * More precisely, we may express this as ‘power against a particular alternative hypothesis’. (DR: may be worth putting maths here at some point, and also give a canonical reference.) For Bayesian analyses, there is some esoteric discussion about ‘whether power is even a thing we should be discussing’. There is uncertainty about the data-generating process, but there is only one data set.* *Maybe add ‘and there is no standard ’null hypothesis testing procedure’. Actually, maybe this point needs a bit more fleshing out? What is the implication of ‘there is only one data set’? Before we conduct an experiment (or run a survey, or collect data for an analysis), there are many hypothetical future data sets we might observe. Whether we favor a frequentist or Bayesian approach, it seems reasonable to ask: ‘Given the range of data that I might observe, how likely is it that I can make certain conclusions?’. The conclusion or inference one wishes to make from a data set can go far beyond simply saying something like “there is a non-zero difference between groups”** (although this is probably the most common inference people first consider). ** Or a comparable statement posed in probablistic terms… Frequentist: ‘if there had been a zero difference between these groups (H0), this data is unlikely to have been generated’. Bayesian: ‘the posterior distribution puts most of the probability mass on there being a difference between groups greater than (some moderate amount).’ We can broaden the idea of power to indicate the probability that our proposed sample yields information that allows us to make some specific kind of inference about the data-generating process. These inferences can take many forms, such as:* DR: Which of these do you consider frequentist and which are Bayesian, and which can be either? the probability of determining that there is a non-zero difference between two conditions, the probability of detecting an effect in a regression model of a specific magnitude (or greater), the probability of detecting some ‘smallest effect size of interest’, the probability of a ‘false positive’, i.e., the probability of concluding that there is a difference between groups when in fact there is no difference, (DR: I didn’t think this would ever be called ‘power’ .. I thought this would be called the ‘size’ of the test), or the probability of achieving a desired level of precision around a particular parameter estimate. Hence, a power analysis helps frame our prospective research project in relation to the goals we would like to achieve (DR: cf the ‘diagnosands’ of the declaredesign framework). It provides us us with an estimate (and it is indeed an estimate, not a certainty!) of the probability that we will be able to make the inference we wish to make, given various factors both inside and outside of our control. (See discussion in fold.) What is ‘in our control’? We might think of sample size as in our control, which it generally is, but this is typically limited by practical considerations outside of our control (such as the availability of a sample or financial constraints). Conversely, effect size is often considered out of our contro;; however we can sometimes increase the ‘dosage’ we give, or try to select a particular group of participants who might be particularly susceptible to our effect of interest. 12.1.3 General workflow for simulation-based power analysis Simulation-based power analysis proceeds in four primary steps: Generate a large number of ‘simulated data sets’ for the analysis.* * These may be generated by draws based on a canonical distribution, like the Gaussian (‘normal’) with particular parameters. Alternately, if prior ‘similar’ data is available (e.g., from outcomes in the year prior to a field experiment), we may prefer to generate it by resampling from this. The data sets generated should be specific to the goal of the study. E.g., suppose we want to know the ‘power (of a particular design and testing procedure) to detect an effect size of 0.2 SD’. Here we should generate data that reflects this effect size (for considering the true positive and false negative rates). If we also want to measure the rate of type-2 error, the rate of false positives (if the null, e.g., an effect side of 0, holds), we should also generate data reflecting this ‘null effect’. Run the proposed analysis over the many simulated data sets (as efficiently as possible, as this can take a long time). This analysis should either return the estimand of interest, or ensure that we can easily compute it (in Step 3). The output should be kept as flexible as possible (while conserving computer memory). This will allow us to assess multiple inference goals on the same output.* *E.g., in a Bayesian analysis, we can get the full posterior distribution for an analysis so it can be assessed and summarised in many ways in step 3. Summarize the output returned in Step 2, computing the share of simulated data sets that meet different decision criteria or inference goals. (Example described in fold) E.g., we might simulate 1000 data sets based on an effect size of 0.3 standard deviations and perform a standard t-test of the difference between treatment and control for each of these. We might then find that for 743 of 1000 of these simulated data, the test ‘rejected the null hypothesis’, suggesting a power of 74.3%. (Feel free to add other examples here.) This can show the likelihood of achieving a range of goals given various sample sizes and design and testing choices, including the rates of misleading conclusions. In frequentist analyses, it is possible that steps 2 and 3 occur together (e.g., the p-value is returned along with the other output). In my experience with typical Bayesian designs, these stages are best kept separate so that we can first do the more time-consuming Step 2, and then more freely explore the various options in Step 3. Assess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results. If not, one may need to think of alternative design or data-collection choices (including sample sizes, treatments, and treatment assignments) or inference goals, and return to Step 1.* * DR: I removed ‘ways of generating data’ because I thought it could be misleading. It seems wrong to first say, e.g., ‘we assumed the a standard normal distribution of outcomes with a standard deviation equal to that observed in prior trials’… and then say ‘but that didn’t have enough power so lets assume a more concentrated distribution’. What I think you meant was consider other ways of actually collecting data or setting up the experiment that would lead to a reasonable expectation of a different data generating process, and then simulate and diagnose this new approach. Note that DD seems to have good tools for comparing and considering design variations. In the sections that follow, I will present some generally useful packages and functions for power analyses, including annotated code examples with particularly useful aspects highlighted. I will do this in the context of a frequentist power analysis for between-groups (=between-subject?) analysis.** ** We give this example is primarily because between-groups analyses run much more quickly than within- subjects analyses. Thus, these can be run without a timewasting headache on your own computer! We hope to add (and link or connect) further examples of common designs in future. 12.1.4 Possible pitfalls/misunderstandings of power analysis It is important to note that power analyses are not an ‘omniscient oracle’. They might better be termed ‘power projections’ or ‘power estimates’. Even if we estimate that we have 99.9% power for detecting some a particular effect, we may have specified our simulations in an unrealistic way. When we actually run an experiment, we might see (e.g.) far more underlying variation or measurement error than we predicted, leading our analyses to be fairly uninformative. Conversely, we might be overly conservative with our power analysis; perhaps a design we thought was ‘underpowered’ actually has a high probability of producing very compelling results.* * DR: I changed the wording here because if we diagnose the design as ‘underpowered’ we probably would choose not to run it in that form. I raise this only to point out that our power analyses might not always be perfect or be something of a blunt instrument. We should recognise they are not guarantees but more a way of determining the basic plausibility of achieving certain goals. Some other things to consider in a similar vein are presented below, and again the intention here is merely to frame our use of power analyses and recognise what sort of things I suspect they can or can’t help us with: When we see real data and real interesting patterns emerge, we are likely to go further in modeling and investigating these patterns than some of the more simple analyses and comparisons we conduct in the initial power analysis. I suspect power analyses are not so good for determining all the intricate, in-depth things we might plumb in a dataset. They are probably better at assessing the tractability of a broad inference goal. We might want to give some consideration to how far we wish to go in the initial data simulation step to think about all sorts of hypothetical data sets. As models become more complex, the number of different parameters that might vary - with possible effects on power - starts to balloon. E.g., even in a simple repeated-measures example, do we wish to vary not only the effect size but all sorts of different correlations from pre- to post-treatment within subjects? If we are simulating ordinal data, then power might change depending on how we initially suggest binning the outcomes, but there are infinitely many ways we might think the data might look… Discussion and consideration of how far we should go with these things is welcome and could be useful! (DR: I’m not sure what you are getting at here. Are you saying that ‘the space of designs and proposed analyses we can explore is extremely large, and we may need to make some ad-hoc choices to avoid this getting unmanageable’?) 12.2 Concrete implementation of framework 12.2.1 Step 1: Generate a large number of data sets for the analysis Confirm that we can generate the basic data we want Because ultimately we might be generating some rather large data files, we increase the memory limit alotted to R first. I don’t believe there is any real cost to increasing this memory limit, so it is wise to do so as to avoid a function iterating many times over for a long time, but ending up without sufficient space to store the outcome: memory.limit(100000) ## [1] Inf Now we want to generate a hypothetical data set. In this case, we will be comparing 4 groups, each shown a different message in a between-subjects design (3 active vs. a control condition with a neutral message). Willem has some nice procedures for generating repeated-measures data in his walkthrough (https://www.willemsleegers.com/posts/simulation-based-power-analyses/) using the library MASS. I think there are likely to be other useful packages or techniques for generating simulated data for more complex designs or patterns of results that we could look into. Being better able to generate valid and informative data sets is probably one of the things that would improve our capacity for running informative power analyses the most. In this example, we will take advantage of the different groups to assess several different possible effect sizes. In a multiple regression, we would then be able to assess whether these different effect sizes come out as significantly different from our control group, and therefore our power to detect different sizes of effects. # tidyverse simply used for data wrangling and plotting library(tidyverse) four.group.datamaker &lt;- function(sim = 1, a = 0, b = .1, c = .2, d = .4, pop=1500) { # first a tibble (data frame) with 1500 ppts, with the different groups showing # effect sizes in Cohen&#39;s d of .1, .2, and .4 four.groups &lt;- tibble(a.control = rnorm(pop, a, 1), b.small = rnorm(pop, b, 1), c.medsmall = rnorm(pop, c, 1), d.medium = rnorm(pop, d, 1), sample.size = 1:pop) %&gt;% # turn the data into long form pivot_longer(cols = &#39;a.control&#39;:&#39;d.medium&#39;, names_to = &#39;group&#39;, values_to = &#39;response&#39;) %&gt;% # put cutpoints in the data to make it more similar to the ordinal responses we would get mutate(ordinal = case_when(response &lt; -1.5 ~ 1, response &lt; -.5 ~ 2, response &lt; .5 ~ 3, response &lt; 1.5 ~ 4, response &gt;= 1.5 ~ 5), # for the purposes of this demo we will not analyse it as ordinal as it takes longer # to run the regressions, but if you did so you would also want to make the response # a factor ordinal = as.factor(ordinal), sim = sim) return(four.groups) } # test that the function works to make one data set before making many! test.data &lt;- four.group.datamaker() ggplot(data = test.data) + geom_density(aes(x = response, fill = group), alpha = .3) + theme( aspect.ratio = .5 ) ggplot(data = test.data) + geom_histogram(aes(x = as.numeric(ordinal)), alpha = .6, position = position_dodge(), bins = 10) + facet_wrap(~group, nrow=1) + theme( aspect.ratio = 1 ) We can see from the plots that the function appears to be working. When developing a data set for the first time, one would usually go further with some ‘diagnostic’ checks to confirm that the data is behaving as you intended. For example, in Willem’s examples, he used the mvnorm function with ‘empirical = TRUE’, so that the exact mean diffreences you specified are present in the data. This can then be confirmed wiht descriptive statistics. There might be all sorts of other diagnostics or plots we might check with other types of data that we generate. Efficiently generate many data sets Now we just need to run the function above many times over. This could be done using loops, but a very useful set of R functions in the tidyverse is the purrr package of map functions. Even better, a package called furrr is available to run such map functions in parallel to further reduce time. This doesn’t matter so much here because this will be quite quick anyway, but is important when we run the analyses over the many data sets. For furrr to do this, we need to tell it to plan for ‘multisession’, and give it a seed number: p_load(furrr) library(furrr) plan(multisession) options &lt;- furrr_options(seed = 48238) # we will pass N = 500 simulations to the map function nsims &lt;- 1:500 # the map function will run our data-making function over 1000 simulations sim.data &lt;- future_map_dfr(.x = nsims, .f = four.group.datamaker, a = 0, b = .1, c = .2, d = .4, .options = options) # split the simulated data into the separate simulations sim.data &lt;- sim.data %&gt;% group_by(sim) %&gt;% group_split() Now, we have 500 simulated data sets representing our hypothetical outcome data, and can perform analyses on them: head(sim.data[[3]]) ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## sample.size group response ordinal sim ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 a.control -0.395 3 3 ## 2 1 b.small -0.396 3 3 ## 3 1 c.medsmall -0.0762 3 3 ## 4 1 d.medium 0.994 4 3 ## 5 2 a.control -0.931 2 3 ## 6 2 b.small -1.58 1 3 12.2.2 Step 2: Run the proposed analysis over the many data sets and return the estimands of interest Before we run an analysis over the many data sets, we need to check that our models will return the estimands that we wish to make inferences from. For a Bayesian analysis, this step might involve dropping parts of the posterior that are not relevant (e.g., estimates of every participant intercept, which take too much space for what they are worth) and ensuring we get the parts we care about (e.g., we might insert some additional code to retrieve a posterior distribution for Cohen’s d, or simply the parameter estimate for the interaction). For Bayesian analyses I err on the side of getting as many of the main parameters as possible, because this is a very time consuming step. For frequentist analyses, there are also a range of estimands we might care about. For example, we might consider returning a p-value, or the upper and lower bounds for confidence intervals, r-squared estimates etc. Again, this depends on the goals one wishes to achieve and what one wants to make inferences about. The key point for any kind of analysis here is that you don’t want to forget an estimand that might be of interest and then have to re-run the entire analysis. In addition, you want to have the regression run on different sample sizes of the data, so that you can generate a power curve plot for the analysis, showing how your power changes according to increasing the sample size. In the example function below, we run a simple linear regression, predicting the response from group. linear.reg.maker &lt;- function(data, breaks) { # this function cuts the data set it is given into different sample sizes cut.samples &lt;- function(break.point, data) { cut.data &lt;- filter(data, sample.size &lt;= break.point) %&gt;% mutate(sample.size = break.point) return(cut.data) } data.cuts &lt;- map_dfr(.x = breaks, .f = cut.samples, data = data) # the data is split according to the sample size # to feed to the regression model data.cuts &lt;- data.cuts %&gt;% group_by(sample.size) %&gt;% group_split() # this function runs the regression run.reg &lt;- function(data) { four.group.form &lt;- as.numeric(ordinal) ~ 1 + group four.group.reg &lt;- lm(formula = four.group.form, data = data) # we extract confidence intervals for the parameters of interest ci99 &lt;- confint(four.group.reg, level = .99) ci95 &lt;- confint(four.group.reg, level = .95) # we create an output to show the confidence intervals around the effects # and some additional inference info, e.g., &#39;nonzero&#39; indicates whether # the lower bound of the CI excludes 0 or not. # &#39;width&#39; indicates the width of the confidence interval, # for assessment of precision output &lt;- tibble(group = c(&#39;small&#39;, &#39;medsmall&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;, &#39;small&#39;, &#39;medsmall&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;), interval = c(.99, .99, .99, .95, .95, .95), lower = c(ci99[[2,1]], ci99[[3,1]], ci99[[4,1]], ci95[[2,1]], ci95[[3,1]], ci95[[4,1]]), upper = c(ci99[[2,2]], ci99[[3,2]], ci99[[4,2]], ci95[[2,2]], ci95[[3,2]], ci95[[4,2]])) %&gt;% mutate(&#39;nonzero&#39; = case_when(lower &gt; 0 ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0), &#39;width&#39; = abs(upper - lower), &#39;sim&#39; = data[[1, &#39;sim&#39;]], &#39;cell.size&#39; = nrow(data)/4) return(output) } # run the regression function over the different sample sizes output &lt;- map_df(.x = data.cuts, .f = run.reg) return(output) } Once we have made and tested that our function works as intended and returns the values we want to make inferences from, we can run it over the many simluated data sets: t1 &lt;- Sys.time() linreg.output &lt;- future_map_dfr(.x = sim.data, .f = linear.reg.maker, breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150)) t2 &lt;- Sys.time() t2 - t1 ## Time difference of 20.82222 secs The object ‘linreg.output’ is now a large dataframe, cataloguing whether or not certain inference thresholds were reached across the many simulations. In the third primary step, we can summarise and graphically display this information. 12.2.3 Step 3: Summarise the output returned in Step 2 to determine likelihood of achieving various inferential goals Now, we wish to ascertain how likely we are to achieve a range of inferential goals, depending on factors such as the sample size, the underlying effect sizes, or whatever else we varied in simulating our data and running our models. For this example, this is as simple as generating a summary of the output from Step 2: # group the data according to group, confidence interval, and size per group four.group.lin.summary &lt;- linreg.output %&gt;% group_by(group, interval, cell.size) %&gt;% # summarise the amount of times we get a CI greater than 0 summarise(.groups = &#39;keep&#39;, &#39;ci above 0 vs. control&#39; = sum(nonzero)/5) %&gt;% # change some factors for plotting mutate(interval = factor(interval, levels = c(&#39;0.95&#39;, &#39;0.99&#39;), labels = c(&#39;95% CI&#39;, &#39;99% CI&#39;)), &#39;Effect size&#39; = factor(group, levels = c(&#39;small&#39;, &#39;medsmall&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;), labels = c(&#39;Very small (.1)&#39;, &#39;Small (.2)&#39;, &#39;Medium (.4)&#39;))) And then plotting the resulting power curve: ggplot(data = four.group.lin.summary) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 1550), breaks = seq(from = 150, to = 1500, by = 150)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 80), linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;, size = .33, alpha = .25) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 90), linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;, size = .33, alpha = .25) + geom_path(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`, group = `Effect size`), size = .66) + geom_point(aes(x = cell.size, y = `ci above 0 vs. control`, color = `Effect size`), size = 1.5) + labs(y = &#39;Power to detect a non-zero effect&#39;, x = &#39;Number of participants per condition (control group not included)&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&#39;#c10d0d&#39;, &#39;#7dc3c2&#39;, &#39;#dcc55b&#39;)) + facet_wrap(~interval) + theme( aspect.ratio = 1, panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0.33), panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0.2), panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;grey96&quot;), axis.line = element_line(color = &#39;black&#39;, size = 0.375), axis.ticks = element_line(color = &#39;black&#39;, size = 0.5), text = element_text(color = &#39;black&#39;, family = &#39;Gill Sans MT&#39;, size = 9), axis.text = element_text(color = &#39;black&#39;, family = &#39;Gill Sans MT&#39;, size = 7), strip.background = element_blank() ) 12.2.4 Step 4. Assess the output and determine whether the proposed analyses and inference goals are realistic and likely to yield informative results. In Step 4, we use the information we have generated above to make substantive conclusions about the projected power of our experiment to detect certain effects, given certain underlying parameters. From this we can make recommendations as to experimental design. Based on the power curve plotted above, we can conclude that we would have a very high likelihood of detecting effects of .4 vs. a control group at even quite low sample sizes, and also a good possibility of detecting effect sizes of .2 at quite modest sample sizes. On the other hand, for the very small effect size, we would not be confident in detecting such a difference vs. a control group even at 1500 participants per group. If effect sizes of this size we what was expected in such an experiment, and it was crucial that they were detected if present, then we might consider going back to Step 1 and reconsidering our experimental design to include even more participants.

We’ve 1345 unique emails for ‘control’ treatment 1 and 1190 unique emails for treatment 2, if I did the quick calculations correctly. (Todo– integrate the data here.) We know some emails are repeated. To analyze this correctly I should bring in the actual distribution of ‘number of times an email is in the data’ and simulate assignment. (Or maybe this is a ‘Poisson’ thing?) As a (perhaps incorrect) first pass I could consider ‘legitimate unique email shows up in the treatment group’ as a random binomial event. (I guess the event is something like ’email is (not) duplicated?) Then we can do the standard binomial (Chi-sq) and Fisher’s exact tests. n1 &lt;- 1345 n2 &lt;- 1190 ( binom_emails &lt;- prop.test(n1, n1+n2, correct=FALSE) ) ## ## 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction ## ## data: n1 out of n1 + n2, null probability 0.5 ## X-squared = 9.4773, df = 1, p-value = 0.00208 ## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.5111129 0.5499385 ## sample estimates: ## p ## 0.530572 ( fisher_emails &lt;- fisher.test(matrix(c(n1, n2, n2, n1), ncol=2)) ) ## ## Fisher&#39;s Exact Test for Count Data ## ## data: matrix(c(n1, n2, n2, n1), ncol = 2) ## p-value = 1.512e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 1.142247 1.428639 ## sample estimates: ## odds ratio ## 1.277394 If the above tests are reasonable, this imbalance is very unlikely to occur by chance. 13.3 How likely are ‘proportions this similar’ under different size ‘true effect sizes’?* * I think this is relates to a ‘power calculation’, but reporting \\(1-power\\). In the next section I started an off-the-cuff simulation approach, in folded code. But I believe that the analytical form here with code and a simulation here should be applicable. 13.3.1 Difference between two binomial random variables. Reprinting and discussing from Stackexchange post “derive the distribution of the difference between two binomial random variables.” I can give you an answer for the pmf of X-Y. From there |X - Y| is straightforward. So we start with \\(X \\sim Bin(n_1, p_1)\\) \\(Y \\sim Bin(n_2, p_2)\\) We are looking for the probability mass function of \\(Z=X-Y\\) Note: in our case we (arguably) care about the difference in ‘proportion of incidences’, but as we also have similar sample sizes (\\(n_1 \\approx n_2\\)) this is basically a normalization First note that the min and max of the support of Z must be \\((-n_2, n_1)\\) since that covers the most extreme cases (\\(X=0\\) and \\(Y=n_2\\)) and (\\(X=n_1\\) and \\(Y=0\\)). Then we need a modification of the binomial pmf so that it can cope with values outside of its support. \\(m(k, n, p) = \\binom {n} {k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\) when \\(k \\leq n\\) and 0 otherwise. Note that this “modified binomial” is what the statistics::dbinom function in R returns. Then we need to define two cases \\(Z \\geq 0\\) \\(Z \\lt 0\\) In the first case \\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2)\\) since this covers all the ways in which X-Y could equal z. Because \\((i+z) - i = z\\), of course … ‘sum up’ the probability of each of these ‘co-occurances’ For example when z=1 this is reached when X=1 and Y=0 and X=2 and Y=1 and X=3 and Y=4 and so on. It also deals with cases that could not happen because of the values of \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). For example if \\(n_2 = 4\\) then we cannot get Z=1 as a combination of X=4 and Y=5. In this case thanks to our modified binomial pmf the probablity is zero. For the second case we just reverse the roles. For example if z=-1 then this is reached when X=0 and Y=1, X=1 and Y=2 etc. \\(p(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2)\\) Put them together and that’s your pmf. \\(f(z)=\\) \\[\\begin{cases} \\sum_{i=0}^{n_1} m(i+z, n_1, p_1) m(i, n_2, p_2),&amp; \\text{if } z\\geq 0\\\\ \\sum_{i=0}^{n_2} m(i, n_1, p_1) m(i+z, n_2, p_2), &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Here’s the function in R and a simulation to check it’s right (and it does work.) https://gist.github.com/ragscripts/9681819 Let me try to apply it… Defining their code for this function: modBin &lt;-dbinom #DR: I just do this renaming here for consistency with the rest ... but the modBin they defined was redundant diffBin&lt;-function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){ prob &lt;- 0 if (z&gt;=0){ for (i in 1:n1){ prob &lt;- prob + modBin(i+z, n1, p1) * modBin(i, n2, p2) } } else { for (i in 1:n2){ prob&lt;-prob+modBin(i+z, n1, p1)*modBin(i, n2, p2) } } return(prob) } 13.3.2 Applying this to present data Rather than using their example, I’ll dive right in to the present case. My notes on the outcomes as of 15 Dec 2021 Treatment 1 - Impact and Treatment 2 - Emotion Story tabs Treatment 1: We record - 8 unique emails donating, 26 donations in total, - worth 5200 USD in total - 1345 unique emails listed as getting ‘control’ treatment 1 Treatment 2: - 6 unique emails, 28 donations so far — worth 7500 USD in total. - 1190 unique emails listed for treatment 2 If I believe my ‘unique emails count’, that implies an 0.59% ‘conversion’ rate for T1 - Control a 0.50% conversion rate for T2 - Emotion/Story Putting the observations into defined objects (later: do from data) n1 &lt;- 1345 n2 &lt;- 1190 d1 &lt;- 8 d2 &lt;- 6 z &lt;- d1-d2 Computation for a few ‘ad-hoc cases’ (later explore the space with vectors of values) Suppose truly equal incidence, at the mean level p1 &lt;- (d1+d2)/(n1+n2) p2 &lt;- p1 ( db_0 &lt;- diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2) ) ## [1] 0.1024599 This implies there is a 10.2% chance of getting this exact difference of +2 incidences between the treatments (in one direction), if the true incidence rates were equal. Let’s plot this for a range of ‘incidence rate differences’ in this region. (Sorry, using the traditional plot, ggplot is better). s &lt;- seq(-10*z, 10*z) p&lt;-sapply(s, function(z) diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)) plot(s,p) We see a large likelihood of values in the range of the +2 difference observed, and a low likelihood of a difference of 10 or more in either direction. 13.3.3 Adaptation: ‘of this magnitude or smaller’ ltmag_diffBin &lt;- function(z, n1, p1, n2, p2){ prob &lt;- 0 z_n &lt;- -z #negative value for (i in z_n:z){ #sum for all integer differences between observed value and its negative, inclusive prob &lt;- prob + diffBin(i, n1, p1, n2, p2) } return(prob) } Now, a similar computation as above, but for ‘this big or smaller in magnitude’: ( mag_db_0 &lt;- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2) ) ## [1] 0.4908031 This implies there is a 49.1% chance of getting a difference no larger than this one in magnitude of +/-2 incidences between the treatments if the true incidence rates were equal. And finally, what we were looking for: the chance of ‘a difference this small or smaller’ as a function of the true difference… Set up an arbitrary vector of ‘true differences’ (to keep it simple, only change it in one direction for now …) Below, I plot Y-axis: ’how likely would a difference in donations ‘as small or smaller in magnitude’” than we see in the data against X-axis: if the “true difference in incidence rates” were of these magnitudes options(scipen=999) B &lt;- c(1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 10) p1 &lt;- rep((d1+d2)/(n1+n2), length(B)) p2 &lt;- p1*B as.list(ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2)*100) %&gt;% format(digits=3, scientific=FALSE) ## [1] &quot;49.1&quot; &quot;39.4&quot; &quot;20.6&quot; &quot;8.02&quot; ## [5] &quot;2.51&quot; &quot;0.153&quot; &quot;0.00000000000855&quot; probmag &lt;- ltmag_diffBin(z, n1, p1, n2, p2) qplot(B, probmag, log = &quot;x&quot;, xlab = &quot;True relative incidence&quot;, ylab =&quot;Prob. of difference this small&quot;) ( probmag_plot &lt;- ggplot() + aes(x=B, y=probmag) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(trans=&#39;log2&#39;) + ylim(0,.51) + xlab(&quot;True relative incidence rate&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Prob. diff. as small as obsd&quot;) ) Hard-coded takeaways 15 Dec 2021 : our data is consistent with ‘no difference’ (of course) … but its also consistent with ‘a fairly large difference in incidence’ E.g., even if one treatment truly lead to ‘twice as many donations as the other’, we still have a 20% chance of seeing a differences as small as the one we see (of 8 versus 6) We can reasonably ‘rule out’ differences of maybe 2.5x or greater Main point: given the rareness of donations in this context, our sample size doesn’t let us make very strong conclusions in either directions … at least not yet. I hope that combined with other evidence, we will be able to infer more 13.4 DR discussion of this case … maybe obsolete We get a 0.59% and a 0.50% conversion rate (share of emails who made at least one contribution in response) for control and treatment, respectively. How likely would it be to have a ‘difference in incidence this small or smaller’ (either 0.09 pp or 0.09/0.5=0.18 proportional difference)… if the true differences in incidence were XXX or larger? (For now, assuming the actual incidence rate is 0.50 for the smaller-incidence treatment … later we could have each of these follow a distribution.) How? For num_sim number of simulations - ‘Control’: \\(i=1..N\\) draws from a binomial(0.005) - ‘Treatment’ N draws from a binomial(0.005*B) where B is the ‘considered effect size’ - Compute the effect_i(B) (the difference in share positive size of the simulated difference’ for this simulation) - Compute: ’what share of simulations have a difference smaller in magnitude than the empirical one. I.e., $_i(|ES_i(B)| &lt; |ES|) $ Do this for a range of considered effect sizes, e.g., \\(B \\in \\{0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) "],["readme-methodology-statistics-design-surveys-experiments-data-analysis-methodology-protocols-and-templates.html", "14 README: methodology-statistics-design, ‘Surveys, experiments, data analysis: Methodology, protocols and templates’ 14.1 ‘Methods and RP Guidelines Bookdown’ 14.2 Folder structure, other resources in this repo", " 14 README: methodology-statistics-design, ‘Surveys, experiments, data analysis: Methodology, protocols and templates’ NOTE: this is now publicly hosted but not indexed.
