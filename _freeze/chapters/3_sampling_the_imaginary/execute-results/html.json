That's the false-positive rate, like the 5% of conventional significance testing. Finally, we have to state the base rate at which hypotheses are true. Suppose for example that 1 in every 100 hypotheses turns out to be true -\n\n> So a positive finding corresponds to a 16% chance that the hypothesis is true\n\n> You can shrink the false-positive rate to 1% and get this posterior probability up to 0.5, only as good as a coin flip. The most important thing to do is to improve the base rate, Pr(true), and that requires thinking, not testing.\n\n\nDR: Or why not shrink the false positive rate even further? In principle you could demand more and more exacting standards, if worse and worse hypotheses are tested. This sort-of provides some justification for 'strict standard NHST'.\n\nBut personally, I suspect that in social science the base rate is much higher because people often test fairly obvious things. (And also, a lot is about measurement, not 0/1 testing in a sparse universe.)\n\n\n::: \n\n## 3.1. Sampling from a grid-approximate posterior\n\nGlobe-tossing model.

But when there is more than one plausible model-and in most mature fields there should be-how should we choose among them? One answer is to prefer models that make good predictions. This answer creates a lot of new questions, since knowing which model will make the best predictions seems to require knowing the future. We'll look at two related tools, neither of which knows the future: cross-validation and information criteria\n\n\n",
