That's the false-positive rate, like the 5% of conventional significance testing. Finally, we have to state the base rate at which hypotheses are true. Suppose for example that 1 in every 100 hypotheses turns out to be true -\n\n> So a positive finding corresponds to a 16% chance that the hypothesis is true\n\n> You can shrink the false-positive rate to 1% and get this posterior probability up to 0.5, only as good as a coin flip. The most important thing to do is to improve the base rate, Pr(true), and that requires thinking, not testing.\n\n\nDR: Or why not shrink the false positive rate even further? In principle you could demand more and more exacting standards, if worse and worse hypotheses are tested. This sort-of provides some justification for 'strict standard NHST'.\n\nBut personally, I suspect that in social science the base rate is much higher because people often test fairly obvious things. (And also, a lot is about measurement, not 0/1 testing in a sparse universe.)\n\n\n::: \n\n## 3.1. Sampling from a grid-approximate posterior\n\nGlobe-tossing model.

I'll skip it. \n\nDR: Hmmm, how is HPDI computed? ... I assume it iterates over intervals, draws observations from within this interval from the posterior sample and sums the probability mass until it settles on the 'best one'?\n\n### 3.2.3. Point estimates {-}\n\n> Given the entire posterior distribution, what value should you report? \n> The Bayesian parameter estimate is precisely the entire posterior distribution \n\n> it is very common for scientists to report the parameter value with highest posterior probability, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate \n\n> Why not report the posterior mean or median? \n\n> repeating this calculation for every possible decision, using \n\n\n**Loss functions: very cool!**\n\n> One principled way to go beyond using the entire posterior as the estimate is to choose a loss function. A loss function is a rule that tells you the cost associated with using any particular point estimate. While statisticians and game theorists have long been interested in loss functions, and how Bayesian inference supports them, scientists hardly ever use them explicitly. The key insight is that different loss functions imply different point estimates.\n\n> loss \\<- sapply( p_grid , function(d) sum( posterior\\*abs( d - p_grid ) ) ) \n\n> p_grid\\[ which.min(loss) \\] \n\n> Different loss functions nominate different point estimates. The two most common examples are the absolute loss as above, which leads to the median as the point estimate, and the quadratic loss (d - p) 2 , which leads to the posterior mean (mean(samples)) as the point estimate \n\n\n> Therefore the implied loss function is highly asymmetric, rising sharply as true wind speed exceeds our guess, but rising only slowly as\n\n> true wind speed falls below our guess. In this context, the optimal point estimate would tend to be larger than posterior mean or median. Moreover, the real issue is whether or not to\n\n> order an evacuation. Producing a point estimate of wind speed may not be necessary at all.\n\n> In this context, the optimal point estimate would tend to be larger than posterior mean or median. Moreover, the real issue is whether or not to order an evacuation. Producing a point estimate of wind speed may not be necessary at all.\\\n\nDR: Reinforcement learning could be better still?\n\n\n\n\n\n> You might argue that the decision to make is whether or not to accept an hypothesis. But the challenge then is to say what the relevant costs and benefits would be, in terms of the knowledge gained or lost\n\n> Usually it's better to communicate as much as you can about the posterior distribution, as well as the data and the model itself, so that others can build upon your work \n\n\n\n\n## 3.3.

If instead you were to use only a single parameter value to compute implied predictions, say the most probable value at the peak of posterior distribution, you-d produce an overconfident distribution of predictions, \n\n> w \\<- rbinom( 1e4 , size=9 , prob=samples ) The symbol samples above is the same list of random samples from the posterior distribution that you-ve used in previous sections. For each sampled value, a random binomial observation is generated \n\n> Now the simulated predictions appear less consistent with the data, as the majority of simulated observations have fewer switches than were observed in the actual sample. This is consistent with lack of independence between tosses of the globe, in which each toss is negatively correlated with the last. Does this mean that the model is bad? That depends \n\n> In the long run, even the wrong model we’ve used throughout the chapter converge on the correct proportion. But it will do so more slowly than the posterior distribution may lead us to believe. \n\n\n\n> posterior predictive checks \n\n> 3.3.2.2. Is the model adequate?\n\nDR: I.e., Does the model and its estimates predict a reasonable (sampled) distribution\n\nMultilevel models \n\n> multilevel model. Multilevel models-also known as hierarchical, random effects, varying effects, or mixed effects models\n\n> Cross-validation and information criteria measure overfitting risk and help us to recognize it. Multilevel models actually do something about it. What they do is exploit an amazing trick known as partial pooling \n\nModel comparison and prediction.\n\n> Bayesian data analysis provides a way for models to learn from data. But when there is more than one plausible model-and in most mature fields there should be-how should we choose among them? One answer is to prefer models that make good predictions. This answer creates a lot of new questions, since knowing which model will make the best predictions seems to require knowing the future. We'll look at two related tools, neither of which knows the future: cross-validation and information criteria\n\n\n",
