All impacts are causal :)\n\n> DAG will tell you the consequences of intervening to change a variable. But only if the DAG is correct\n\n> Perhaps a direct effect would arise because younger people change faster than older people and are therefore more likely to grow incompatible with a partner. Second, it has an indirect effect by influencing the marriage rate, which then influences divorce, A $\\rightarrow$ M $\\rightarrow$ D\n\n> these different arrows, we need more than one statistical model.\n\n> Model m5.1, the regression of D on A, tells us only that the total influence of age at marriage is strongly negative with divorce rate\n\nDR:[^spurious_waffles-7]\n\n[^spurious_waffles-7]: May not be *influence*... because unobserved factor could drive both\n\n> The 'total' here means we have to account for every path from A to D. There are two such paths in this graph: $A \\rightarrow D$, a direct path, and $A \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow D$, an indirect path. In general, it is possible that a variable like A has no direct effect at all on an outcome like D. It could still be associated with D entirely through the indirect path. That type of relationship is known as mediation, and we'll have another example later.\n\n> This DAG is also consistent with the posterior distributions of models m5.1 and m5.2. Why? Because both M and D 'listen' to A\n\n> conditional independencies ... which variables become dis-associated when we condition on some other set of variables.\n\n... that every pair of variables is correlated. This is because there is a causal arrow between every pair. These arrows create correlations.\n\nDR:[^spurious_waffles-8]\n\n[^spurious_waffles-8]: but effects could add up to zero by coincidence. (Actually, he has a case like this further down, he just fails to mention it here.)\n\n> They share a cause, and this leads them to be correlated with one another through that cause. But suppose we condition on A. All of the information in M that is relevant to predicting D is in A. So once we've conditioned on A, M tells us nothing more about D. So in the second DAG, a testable implication is that D is independent of M, conditional on A. In other words, $D \\perp M|A$.\n\n> Here's the code to define the second DAG and display the implied conditional independencies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dagitty)\n\nDMA_dag2 <- dagitty::dagitty('dag{ D <- A -> M }')\nimpliedConditionalIndependencies( DMA_dag2 )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nD _||_ M | A\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> So for example once you fit a multiple regression to predict divorce using both marriage rate and age at marriage, the model addresses the questions: (1) After I already know marriage rate, what additional value is there in also knowing age at marriage? (2) After I already know age at marriage, what additional value is there in also knowing marriage rate?\n\nDR: how can we differentiate 1 from 2:[^spurious_waffles-9]\n\n[^spurious_waffles-9]: We see this below in the simulated examples. One column may be redundant after you know another ... e.g., an individual forecaster's prediction is redundant once you see the market price in an efficient prediction market. But the reverse may not hold; the market price is still informative after knowing a single forecaster's prediction, because the former has *more information*. However, in practice this is challenging because of additional unobservables, and 'showing a lack of effect' requires a more sophisticated equivalence-testing approach than the one he gives below.\n\n### Coding data vis and univariate models (Kurz) {.unnumbered}\n\nKurz on themes and plots:[^spurious_waffles-10]\n\n[^spurious_waffles-10]: Going forward, each chapter will have its own plot theme.

Couldn't any such response run the risk of overfitting?\n\n## (Simulating) the various problems (Spurious association, masking, ...)\n\nDR: This seems like an important check on our work. Such simulations may have a high type-1 error, yielding 'false negatives' (where we see 'hmm, the results look fine, no bias here') by coincidence. But they should have a low or zero type-2 error, if done right. Where we can simulate a 'biased case', we know such a bias is a potential threat.\n\n### Masked relationship {.unnumbered}\n\n> tends to arise when there are two predictor variables that are correlated with one another. However, one of these is positively correlated with the outcome and the other is negatively correlated with it\n\nE.g.,\n\n-   Outcome: `ENGAGE` 'self-reported engagement'\n\n-   `time_in_EA`: Positive relation to `ENGAGE`\n\n-   `Interest_Global_health`: Negative relation to `ENGAGE`\n\n-   `time_in_EA`, `Interest_Global_health`: Positive relationships\n\nSo, a simple model of `ENGAGE ~ time_in_EA` might find a zero (or 'too small') relationship, suggesting `time_in_EA` has little or no (causal) impact on engagement. However in a model like `ENGAGE ~ time_in_EA + Interest_Global_health` we might see the latter has a negative relationship to the outcome and the former a positive one.\n\n![](images/paste-6C1F2D9A.png)\n\n> Why did adding neocortex and body mass to the same model lead to stronger associations for both? This is a context in which there are two variables correlated with the outcome, but one is positively correlated with it and the other is negatively correlated with it. In addition, both of the explanatory variables are positively correlated with one another. Try a simple `pairs(~K + M + N , dcc )` plot to appreciate this pattern of correlation. The result of this pattern is that the variables tend to cancel one another out.\n\n![](images/paste-EA5FA8F8.png)\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n> Beginning on the left, the first possibility is that body mass (M) influences neocortex percent (N). Both then influence kilocalories in milk (K). Second, in the middle, neocortex could instead influence body mass. The two variables still end up correlated in the sample. Finally, on the right, there could be an unobserved variable U that influences both M and N, producing a correlation between them. In this book, I'll circle variables that are unobserved. One of the threats to causal inference is that there are potentially many unobserved variables thatinfluence an outcome or the predictors.\n> \t\t\t\t\t\n>\n> Which of these graphs is right? We can't tell from the data alone, because these graphs imply the same set of conditional independencies. In this case, there are no conditional independencies---each DAG above implies that all pairs of variables are associated, regardless of what we condition on. A set of DAGs with the same conditional independencies is known as a Markov equivalence set.\t\t\t\n>\n> *the data alone can never tell you which causal model is correct*\n\n## Categorical variables {.unnumbered}\n\nDR: This section is rather straightforward. The key -- *and highly useful* -- insight: *Remove the intercept when modeling with categorical features.*\n\nThis yields a specific estimate for each category or combination of categories. Why?\n\n-   There is no 'base category', making interpretation easier.\n\n-   It avoids the challenges (particular to Bayesian approaches) of including an 'additive adjustment coefficient relative to the base group', which naturally (and misleadingly) implies more variance in the non-base groups.\n\nDownside: the coefficients can't be interpreted as 'effects' or adjustments, potentially making (direct) interpretation statistical inference more difficult in some contexts.\n\nRemedy to this: Explicitly model/test these differences through simulation, easily done in a Bayesian framework\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## DR question: Does this apply to frequentist analysis too?\n\nIs it Bayesian specific? How does this relate to 'contrast-coding'?\n:::\n\n> Many readers will already know that variables like this, routinely called *factors*, can easily be included in linear models.
