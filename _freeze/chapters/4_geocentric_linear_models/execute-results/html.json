A real and important example is financial time series\n\nAfter laying out his soccer field coin toss shuffle premise, McElreath wrote:\n\n> It's hard to say where any individual person will end up, but you can say with great confidence what the collection of positions will be. The distances will be distributed in approximately normal, or Gaussian, fashion. This is true even though the underlying distribution is binomial. It does this because there are so many more possible ways to realize a sequence of left-right steps that sums to zero. There are slightly fewer ways to realize a sequence that ends up one step left or right of zero, and so on, with the number of possible sequences declining in the characteristic bell curve of the normal distribution.

But it's not easy to grasp why addition should result in a bell curve of sums. Here's a conceptual way to think of the process. Whatever the average value of the source distribution, each sample from it can be thought of as a fluctuation from the average value. When we begin to add these fluctuations together, they also begin to cancel one another out. A large positive fluctuation will cancel a large negative one. The more terms in the sum, the more chances for each fluctuation to be canceled by another, or by a series of smaller ones in the opposite direction. So eventually the most likely sum, in the sense that there are the most ways to realize it, will be a sum in which every fluctuation is canceled by another, a sum of zero (relative to the mean). (pp. 73--74)\n\n### Normal by multiplication {.unnumbered}\n\n> small effects that multiply together are approximately additive, and so they also tend to stabilize on Gaussian distributions\n\n> Large deviates that are multiplied together do not produce Gaussian distributions, but they do tend to produce Gaussian distributions on the log scale\n\n**Skipped coding this for now**\n\n### Using Gaussian distributions (\"but why?\") {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Ontological justification. {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Gaussian is\n\n> a widespread pattern, appearing again and again at different scales and in different domains. Measurement errors, variations in growth, and the velocities of molecules all tend towards Gaussian distributions. These processes do this because at their heart, these processes add together fluctuations. And repeatedly adding finite fluctuations results in a distribution of sums that have shed all information about the underlying process, aside from mean and spread. One consequence of this is that statistical models based on Gaussian distributions cannot reliably identify micro-process. (p. 75)\n\n\\~I.e., we cannot 'prove what we assumed'.\n\n> Kurz: But they can still be useful.\n\n#### Epistemological justification.\n\n> Another route to justifying the Gaussian as our choice of skeleton, and a route that will help us appreciate later why it is often a poor choice, is that it represents a particular state of ignorance. When all we know or are willing to say about a distribution of measures (measures are continuous values on the real number line) is their mean and variance, then the Gaussian distribution arises as the most consistent with our assumptions.\n>\n> That is to say that the Gaussian distribution is the most natural expression of our state of ignorance, because if all we are willing to assume is that a measure has finite variance, the Gaussian distribution is the shape that can be realized in the largest number of ways and does not introduce any new assumptions. It is the least surprising and least informative assumption to make. In this way, the Gaussian is the distribution most consistent with our assumptions... If you don't think the distribution should be Gaussian, then that implies that you know something else that you should tell your golem about, something that would improve inference.

The range of observed weights\n\nWe know that average height increases with average weight, at least up to a point. Let-s try restricting it to positive values. The easiest way to do this is to define the prior as Log-Normal instead\n\nthere are many analyses in which no amount of data makes the prior irrelevant\n\nnullWe don-t pay any attention to p-values in this book. But the danger remains, if we choose our priors conditional on the observed sample, just to get some desired result. The procedure we-ve performed in this chapter is to choose priors conditional on pre-data knowledge of the variables- their constraints, ranges, and theoretical relationships. This is why the actual data are not shown in the earlier section. We are judging our priors against general facts, not the sample. We bayesian p hacking? this needs elaboration\n\nTDR: his seems to be Jamie Elsey's point about reluctance to use any of the data/knowledg from the data in setting the priors, even over hyperparameters. The 'empirical Bayes' guy seems to disagree with this.\n\nYou can usefully think of $y = log(x)$ as assigning to y the order of magnitude of $x$. The function $x = exp(y)$ is the reverse, turning a magnitude into a value\n\nNote the exp(log_b) in the definition of mu. This what's the benefit of this substitution?\n\nThere are two broad categories of processing: (1) reading tables and (2) plotting simulations.\n\nemphasize plotting posterior distributions and posterior predictions, instead of attempting to understand a table\n\nPlotting the implications of your models will allow you to inquire about things that are hard to read from tables: (1) Whether or not the model fitting procedure worked correctly (2) The absolute magnitude, rather than merely relative magnitude, of a relationship between outcome and predictor (3) The uncertainty surrounding an average relationship (4) The uncertainty surrounding the implied predictions of the model, as these are distinct from mere parameter uncertainty\n\nPosterior probabilities of parameter values describe the relative compatibility of different states of the world with the data, according to the model\n\nmarginal posterior distributions of the parameters 'marginal' bc we are integrating or summing across the other parameters when estimating these measures for each parameter\n\n. It is most certainly not evidence that the relationship between weight and height is linear, because the model only considered lines. It just says that, if you are committed to a line, then lines with a slope around 0.9 are plausible ones\n\nto describe the quadratic posterior completely. For that, we also require the variance-covariance matrix We somehow estimated the (MAP?) values of the parameters in a series of simulations (I forgot how). Now we also consider the variance and covariance of these. Is this simply the empirical variance and covariance across simulations? (And then IIRC quap uses these to generate a more complete posterior and sample from it or something). I guess this is helpful because in each simulation I only need to derive a few things, the sort of max confidence values of the parameters, rather than the posterior probability for all possible values. We also can, in principle, use only a few simulations (shown later) and derive an estimate of that covariance matrix and then, assuming normality or something, draw from the joint posterior implied by that covariance matrix to plot things.\n\nnullan informal check on model assumptions. When the model-s predictions don-t come close to key observations or patterns in the plotted data, then you might suspect the model either did not fit correctly or is rather badly specified we do something like this in our 80k work etc when we compare the results from a 'model' to mean differences across conditions\n\nnullBut for even slightly more complex models, especially those that include interaction effects (Chapter 8), interpreting posterior distributions is hard\n\nnullposterior distribution considers every possible regression line connecting height to weight. It assigns a relative plausibility to each. This means that each combination of - and - has a posterior probability. It could be that there are many lines with nearly the same posterior probability as the average line. Or it could be instead that the posterior distribution is rather narrow near the average\n\nwe could sample a bunch of lines from the posterior distribution. Then we could display those lines on the plot, to visualize the uncertainty in the regression relationship. Drawing randomly from the posterior distributin will of course draw more 'likely' lines more often\n\nEach row is a correlated random sample from the joint posterior of all three parameters, using the covariances provided by vcov(m4.3). The\n\naverage of very many of these lines is the posterior mean line I don't understand ... is he implying that the MAP line will also be the \"average\" of the intercept and slope coefficients or something?\n\nThe cloud of regression lines displays greater uncertainty at extreme values for weight\n\nNotice that the cloud of regression lines grows more compact as the sample size increases. This is a result of the model growing more confident about the location of the mean. More confident about what mean? Does he mean 'more confident about the slope'?\n\nI think he means \"more confident about the slope of the mean height in weight, as well as about the intercept ... thus more confident about the mean height for wach weight\n\ntake your quap approximation, sample from the posterior distribution, and then compute - for each case in the data and sample from the posterior distribution. Here\n\n We actually want something slightly different: a distribution of - for each unique weight value on the horizontal axis. It-s only slightly harder to compute that, by just passing link some new data:\n\nRead apply(mu,2,mean) as compute the mean of each column (dimension -2-) of the matrix mu. Nowmu.mean contains the average - at each weight value, and mu.PI contains 89% lower and upper bounds for each weight value\n\ntrue that it is possible to use analytical formulas to compute intervals like this\n\napproach, and there is some additional insight that comes from knowing the mathematics, the pseudo-empirical approach presented here is very flexible and allows a much broader audience of scientists to pull insight from their statistical modeling. And again, when you start estimating models with MCMC (Chapter 9), this is really the only approach available\n\nUse link to generate distributions of posterior values for -. The default behavior of link is to use the original data, so you have to pass it a list of new horizontal axis values you want to plot posterior predictions across. (2) Use summary functions like mean or PI to find averages and lower and upper bounds of - for each value of the predictor variable. (3) Finally, use plotting functions like lines and shade to draw the lines and intervals. Or you might plot the distributions of the predictions, or do further numerical calculations with them. It-s really up to you. This recipe works for every model we fit in the book Is there a comparable 'universal recipe' in the tidy \"love letter\" adaptation?\n\ngenerating an 89% prediction interval for actual heights, not just the average height, -. This means we-ll incorporate the standard deviation - and its uncertainty as well\n\nFor any unique weight value, you sample from a Gaussian distribution with the correct mean - for that weight, using the correct value of - sampled from the same posterior distribution. what does he mean by 'correct' here?\n\nnulldo this for every sample from the posterior, for every weight value of interest, you end up with a collection of simulated heights that embody the uncertainty in the posterior as well as the uncertainty in the Gaussian distribution of heights. There is a tool called sim which does this:\n\nThis matrix is much like the earlier one, mu, but it contains simulated heights A vector of simulated heights for each element in the weight sequence\n\nYou could plot the boundary for other percents, such as 67% and 97% (also both primes), and add those to the plot. it would be nice to plot several of these together, perhaps a gradual distribution/elevation plot of confidence\n\nFor every distribution like dnorm, there is a companion simulation function dnorm -- species the density at any point (I guess) rnorm -- randomly generates frmo the normal distribution\n\n## Curves from lines (4.5)\n\nThe first is polynomial regression. The second is b-splines I need to know more about how to use the splines\n\nBut in general it is better to pre-process any variable transformations-you don-t need the computer to recalculate the transformations on every iteration of the fitting procedure\n\nThe parameter - (a) is still the intercept, so it tells us the expected value of height when weight is at its mean value. But it is no longer equal to the mean height in the sample, since there is no guarantee it should in a polynomial regression\n\nWe aren-t learning any causal relationship between height and weight\n\nB-splines do not directly transform the predictor by squaring or cubing it. Instead they invent a series of entirely new, synthetic predictor variables. Each of these synthetic variables exists only to gradually turn a specific parameter on and off within a specific range of the real predictor variable. Each of the synthetic variables is called a basis function\n\nThe linear model ends up looking very familiar: -i = - + w1Bi,1 + w2Bi,2 + w3Bi,3 + ... where Bi,n is the n-th basis function-s value on row i, and the w parameters are corresponding weights for each\n\ndivide the full range of the horizontal axis into four parts, using pivot points called knots. The\n\nThese synthetic variables are used to gently transition from one region of the horizontal axis to the next. Essentially, these variables tell you which knot you are close to. Beginning on the left of the top plot, basis function 1 has value 1 and all of the others are set to zero. As we move rightwards towards the second knot, basis 1 declines and basis 2 increases. At knot 2, basis 2 has value 1, and all of the others are set to zero\n\nthey make the influence of each parameter quite local. At any point on the horizontal axis in Figure 4.12, only two basis functions have non-zero values\n\nParameters called weights multiply the basis functions. The spline at any given point is the sum of these weighted basis functions\n\nthe knots are just values of year that serve as pivots for our spline. Where should the knots go?\n\nsimple example above, place the knots at different evenlyspaced quantiles of the predictor variable. This gives you more knots where there are more observations. We\n\nnext choice is polynomial degree. This determines how basis functions combine, which determines how the parameters interact to produce the spline not fully explained\n\nthe w priors influence how wiggly the spline can be\n\n",
