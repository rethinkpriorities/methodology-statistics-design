I think this first focuses on a frequentist approach, but it's likely to also introduce a Bayesian approach.\n\n## Value of information, optimal trial design\n\n### Why VOI instead of Power? {.unnumbered}\n\n> N = 680 per cell is enough to have 95% power to detect a Cohen's d of 0.20 ... multiple comparisons. etc\n\nThe power calculation approach might implicitly assue we need $p=0.01$ otherwise \"we can't reject the null\" ... which is vulnerable to being rounded up to \"we can't make any inference.\" \n\nI (Reinstein) think this the wrong way to consider it. If we think it's even 55% likely that message A is better than message B, we should choose message A. We have learned something.[^exp_design_quant-4]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-4]: But of course it's better if we can use a procedure that has a lower rates of false positive. Why? Because if we do what I just said, we are choosing the wrong message 45% of the time, so our net gain is lower ... maybe only a net gain of something like 'choosing the better message an additional 10% of the time'.\n\n*Reframing the discussion:* \n\n... Not \"how many observations do we need for this to be useful at all\" we should be thinking/considering \n\n.. Instead \"even small amounts of data permit useful learning\"... so  \"how much data should we collect until it is no longer worth the cost ... to maximize our net gain from better decisionmaking?\"[^exp_design_quant-5] \n\nThis is a VOI calculation.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-5]: I'm saying this in the context of real-world decision problems, not necessarily considering scientific studies or studies trying to establish general truths and convince skeptical audiences of surprising results.)\n\n### VOI and Optimal Design and inference: framework {.unnumbered}\n\nFor a decision-maker ('DM'), knowing one condition is (e.g.) 80% likely to perform better than another may be very valuable. Still, the benefit of this depends on:\n\n1.  How does the 'better' metric (e.g., mean of Likert measures) translate into proximate and ultimate outcomes? [^exp_design_quant-6]\n\n2.  'How much better is better?'; e.g., what is the expected gain in the ultimate outcome, incorporating the costs of being 'wrong in either direction'? \n\n3.  How much is the ultimate outcome valued?[^exp_design_quant-7]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-6]: E.g., signing up for EA coaching/changing jobs for greater impact, respectively\n\n[^exp_design_quant-7]: E.g., the value of a positive career change.\n\nUltimately, we want to choose our design and analysis strategy to maximize the \"Value of Information\" (VOI), minus the cost of acquiring this information. Call this strategy ($\\Sigma$)[^exp_design_quant-8] and the information set at the end of the trial be $\\Theta(\\Sigma)$[^exp_design_quant-9]. This VOI is essentially the difference between: [^exp_design_quant-10]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-8]: a vector or matrix\n\n[^exp_design_quant-9]: It will also a function of a random term.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-10]: incorporating some Greek letters to make it look fancy\n\n1.  $V_1(\\Sigma) \\equiv E\\Big[V\\big(\\mathbf{\\Phi}|D(\\Theta(\\Sigma)\\big)\\Big]$\n\nThe expected value of the outcomes $\\mathbf{\\Phi}$ according to the DM's criteria[^exp_design_quant-11], given the decisions $D$ that will be made, in light of the information $\\Theta$ gained from trials that use design $\\Sigma$.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-11]: E.g., the 'client' EA organization, and perhaps other stakeholders\n\n2.  $V_0 \\equiv E[V(\\mathbf{\\Phi}|D(\\Theta_0))]$\n\nThe 'value of the outcomes...' given decisions made without any further information, i.e., with the information set $\\Theta_0$ that we will have in the absence of the trial.\n\nHence the VOI is:[^exp_design_quant-12]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-12]: Note this term is also an expectation, but using expectations operators everywhere gets cumbersome; we may bring these (integrals) back again where we need to do explicit calculations.\n\n$$V(\\Sigma) = V_1 - V_0$$\n\nThus we want to choose our design $\\Sigma$ to maximize the VOI net of the costs of running the design ($C(\\Sigma)$):\n\n$$\\Pi(\\Sigma) :=   V_1(\\Sigma) -  V_0 - C(\\Sigma).$$\n\nOf course, the design does not affect $V_0$, so we only need to worry about finding the design $\\Sigma$ that achieves the highest value of:\n\n$$V_1(\\Sigma) - C(\\Sigma) = E\\Big[V\\big(\\mathbf{\\Phi}|D(\\Theta(\\Sigma)\\big)\\Big] - C(\\Sigma).$$\n\n### Operationalizing this {.unnumbered}\n\nWe need to come up with explicit measures of:[^exp_design_quant-13]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-13]: So far, this is all just defining terms, and potentially obvious. We need to start operationalizing this.\n\n1.  The **specific design choices** we are considering, i.e., some subset of $\\Sigma$.\n\n(E.g., 'how many conditions, which conditions, and how many individuals assigned to each condition'.)\n\n2.  The **information we can gain** from the trials, making inferences from an observed vector $\\mathbf{Y}$, e.g.,\n\n-   $s_j \\in [0,10]$ the survey mean of our 'interest in the DM's organization' questions among Prolific participants, for each of conditions $j \\in t_0, t_1, ..., t_k$, and,\n-   $c_j \\in [0,1]$ the 'share that click on the organization's web link' ...\n\n3.  The joint (prior) distribution over the information we can observe and the real-world outcomes/rates we are interested in, $F(\\mathbf{Y}, \\mathbf{\\Phi})$. More simply, some quantification of 'how can we make inferences about the real world outcomes given what we will observe in the study?'\n\nE.g.,\n\n> we expect the real world conversion rate for a condition[^exp_design_quant-14] to be distributed with a Beta distribution centered at the mean of a weighted function of the true 'Prolific click rate' in that condition and the true average 'interest in the organization score', multiplied by some scaling factor.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-14]: where 'conversion' means \"a YouTube viewer clicks on the ad and signs up for coaching\"\n\n4.  The (relative) **value of the world** under each specific outcome. E.g., the dollar value the DM puts on some real-world conversion rate $\\phi$[^exp_design_quant-15]\n\n5.  The **cost** of our possible design decisions. E.g., the cost per additional participant.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-15]: This should also take into account how long the ads informed by this trial are going to run for and other factors.\n\n*Next*: If we can fill in some of this, we may be able to make considered but heroic assumptions over the rest, and generate a VOI measure as a function of our design choices.[^exp_design_quant-16]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-16]: This would probably benefit from multiple quasi-independent takes and some benchmarks against 'outside views'. We probably want to look to existing models and approaches for guidance. And we may want to substitute reasonable proxy measures for things of ultimate interest.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Why go down this rabbit hole?\n\nMost of the gains from this will not be specific to this particular trial but will come in helping us developing an approach to later work for this partner and others.\n:::\n\n### Building a tangible approach to VOI\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Extending this 'benefit' to optimizing net-VOI\n\nWhat is the benefit of (e.g.) 'getting it right an additional 10% of the time?'\n\nThis depends on 'how much better is the better message'? But of course, the greater the extent it is better, the more likely we will (correctly) deem it to be better, even with a small sample.\n\nSo, to get at the VOI as a function of sample size we will have to start with a prior distribution over \"the magnitude of superiority of one message over another.\" Then we draw from this, draw the number of observations simulating our design, and simulate the distribution value achieved as a function of sample size. I think we can actually do this!\n\n\n:::\n\n[^exp_design_quant-13]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-13]: We won't have time to fully sort this out for the current trial, but I'm pretty convinced it is worth working towards.\n-->\n```\n\n### A specific proposal for comparing the VOI of designs {.unnumbered}\n\nEssentially^[Reinstein: This may be  reinventing a wheel I'm not familiar with.]\n\n1.  Set (and carefully consider) a reasonable **prior distribution over the 'message performance in the real world'**[^exp_design_quant-18]... across a range/random draw of possible messages (say, $M$ total messages, indexed by $m$).\n\n[^exp_design_quant-18]: E.g., 'the probability a random person drawn from the real-world audience signs up for coaching after seeing the real world version of a message.'\n\nE.g., let the individual probability of signup have a Beta distribution with a mean $u_m$ for message $m$. Assume these means $u_m$ are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution.\n\n2.  Make heroic assumptions over the **connection between the observed metric**[^exp_design_quant-19] **and the true outcome** (example above).[^exp_design_quant-20]\n\n3.  **Simulate the distribution of value** for each design we are considering $k \\in K$^[Or $\\Sigma_k$ to be consistent with the previous notation.]. For each design $k$, for each simulation $t$, we will do the following.\n\n    A.  Simulate 'what we report to the client':\n\n        i.  Draw the parameters of the 'true value' of performance (of each message) from the prior (call it $\\Phi_t$ for sim $t$, perhaps a vector of length $M$). Given these parameters...\n\n        ii. Consider a 'Sample population' $N(k)$ equal to the size as specified in design $k$. Simulate assigning each of $N(k)$ individuals (indexed by $i$) to a 'message treatment $m=m_i$', with this assignment following design $k$.\n\n        iii. Draw 'real outcomes for each sample individual $i$', if they were to be assigned to message $m_i$ in the real world, i.e., $Y_i(m_i)$,\\[\\^exp_design_quant-5\\]\n\n        iv. Draw the 'survey metric' $s_{im} = Y_{im} + error$^[E.g., mean Likert scores] for each individual, were they to be assigned to message treatment $m_i$. Let the latter vector for all individuals in the simulated sample $t$ be $S_t(\\Phi_t))$.\n\n        v.  Estimate $\\beta(S_t)$, the 'metric we would report to the client' as a function of the above vector $S_t(I_t))$. This could be something simple, like a rank-ordering of the mean values of the Likert measure for each treatment.\n\n    B.  Calculate the 'client's message choice' given this information. For simplicity (for now), assume the client optimizes in some way. E.g.,  assume they assign all real-world people to the one treatment that performed best by our reported metric $\\beta(\\Phi_t)$), Call this message choice $m^{*}_t$.\n\n    C.  Estimate the value achieved by this choice:\n\n        i.  Let $W$ be the number of people affected^[E.g., the number the client wants to serve the ads to]. Draw $W$ individuals from the simulated population, still using parameters $\\Phi_t$ for these draws\n\n        ii. Imagine each of these are assigned message $m^{*}_t$.^[... According to the above 'client's choice procedure given our reporting'] Draw 'simulated real outcomes' for each of these individuals for this message. I.e., $Y_{i}(m^{*}_t)$.\n\n    D.  Report the total value achieved (most simply $W \\times y_{i}(m^{*}_t)$) and call this value $V_t(k)$: the \"value achieved in simulation $t$ under design $k$.\"\n\n4.  Do this simulation for each design choice $k$, and report the distribution of value $V_t(k)$. We can then do this simulation for each of a range of relevant design choices $k$ ^[including sample sizes, how many messages, number assigned to each message, etc] to compare performance.^[We can also test the sensitivity to different priors, different metrics reported to clients, client decision rules, etc.]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-19]: E.g., the average Likert score on Prolific\n\n[^exp_design_quant-20]: Making an assumption about this connection is challenging, with a lot of possible reasoning paths. Perhaps a joint distribution, or perhaps something simpler like a proportional relationship with an error term (if a message's Likert result is 10% better it will perform 10% better in the real world +/- some independent error term.)\n\n### Coded: Simple example of the VOI simulation {-}\n\nWe next code and present a \"bare bones example\" <!-- TODO: more things to flesh out test sensitivity to. -->\n\n> In this case I imagine having to choose between 5 messages with different (unknown) efficacy. You can just guess which is best, or field the messages to 20, 100, or 1000 people each. Then as the decision criteria you just suggest picking the one with the best mean.\n\n> Suppose this costs 2 USD per participant\n\n> Then I imagine some conversion from their scores to their likelihood of signing up to something, and I say the value of a sign up is \\$40 (this could be changed, or estimated for various values in principle).\n^[DR note: I very slightly reworded Jamie's language above, for clarity]\n\n^[DR: In our present  context (which I won't discuss here) I think the clients would say the value of actually signing up is much higher ... but 40 dollars for a 'real world click on their site coming from these ads' might be in the right range.]\n\n> Then I imagine the messages are 'for real' going to be fielded to 200,000 people - and I simulate them being fielded for each item at the ratio those items were [chosen as best in our simulations] based on each design.\n\n[^exp_design_quant-21]\n\n[^exp_design_quant-21]: DR: I'm pretty sure he means 'at the rate that these were chosen as the *best message* by our simulations of an experiment', not at the rate the individuals choose these messages.

To get the *expected* value, for each design, we weight this by the simulated probability that a message 'comes out best'.\n\n<!--  at the ratios of the times they selected the different messages given the different designs. 00\n# I add a guess version, in which each item is just assigned equal probability\n# of being picked, as if they did it at random -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvalue_for_messages <- pmap_dfr(.l = list(group = c(twenty_hundred_thousand$selected, c(rep(\"a\", 200),\n                                                                                   rep(\"b\", 200),\n                                                                                   rep(\"c\", 200),\n                                                                                   rep(\"d\", 200),\n                                                                                   rep(\"e\", 200))),\n                                                design = c(twenty_hundred_thousand$n_per_group, rep(\"guess\", 1000)),\n                                                sim = c(twenty_hundred_thousand$sim, 3001:4000)),\n                                      .f = score_to_conversion)\n\n#Note -- the above takes a few minutes, and throws a lot of warnings 'cost = case_when(...)`.
