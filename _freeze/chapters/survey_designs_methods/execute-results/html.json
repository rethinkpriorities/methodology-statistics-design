I found it interesting, I am enthusiastic, I would definitely sign up, etc.)\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Discussion of ordering attitude measures\n> DR:   I see the case for increasing order is 'it makes it more clear for them to follow/more coherent to respond.  On the other hand, it could lead to less careful consideration of each response and a mechanical 'I better increase it'\n\n> DM: If we want to test how many people will say they would be likely to do 1/2/3/4/5/6 I think we want to minimise the influence of order (or anything extraneous) on their likelihood of selecting 1/2/3/4/5/6. Ordering them by perceived commitment seems like it can only serve to nudge them in untoward ways to be more or less likely to select some.\n\n> Also I don't think we have good grounds to predict what the order of increasing commitment is or to assume this is invariant across respondents.\n\n> DR: OK, I see your point, if we actually  want to know, and see these as measures of how many people will do/think each of these things. As a 'measure of commitment and affinity' the ordering makes some sense to me.\n\n:::\n\n\n**Quiz questions, 'information search' (googling) and honesty**\n\nWe often want to measure knowledge or recall but in online surveys people can look things up. Will they do so, and how does it depend on the incentive? Can this be deterred?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Discussion of honesty and Hugh-Jones work\n\n  Re whether people cheat on unincentivized survey responses to quiz questions online when googling is possible, I consulted my ‘experiment gang’. David Hugh-Jones had a paper published in 2016 in which (he says) most US and UK people were honest and didn’t look things up[ even when there was an incentive.\nI’m trying to dig out those precise numbers but to me...\n\nThis is possibly a lower bound on the level of honesty without compensation if we asked, say quiz questions that indicate familiarity with 80,000 hours.\n(of course it’s not airtight, you could make a case that people might be more honest in a case where there is compensation because they feel like it’s more of a moral issue or that there will be more curiosity in this case, or that lookup was more work in his case… but still)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Detecting and Deterring Information Search in Online Surveys Matthew H. Graham*\n\nFrom Twitter:\n\n> Looking up the answers to knowledge questions in online surveys is far too prominent.\n\n> A simple promise not to cheat can cut down a lot of it.\n\n>  So can implementing a supplied script to detect when the participant leaves the screen.\n\n:::\n",
