However, as that data itself cannot be in the public domain, this is less useful for people who don't have access to our Github repo, and less than ideal in general. \n\nSome sources of data and examples could include:\n\n1. Data from the [EA Market Testing Team](https://bit.ly/eamtt)'s public work, see [the data treatment here](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt_data_analysis/); simplifying this data might be helpful for our examples\n\n1. Other Reinstein projects, including data from the [ICRC chapter](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/icrc_design.html#icrc_design) of the 'impact of impact information' project, or JustGiving data [e.g., see codebook here](https://daaronr.github.io/just-giving-public-prediction-/codebooks/codebook_uc_fdd_fd.html)\n\n1. Simulated data like (a simplified version of) the EA Survey data\n\n1. Any RP or adjacent survey data that *has* been put in the public domain^[Are there any?]\n\n1. Simulated data resembling that of other confidential EAMT and RP projects\n\n\n## Some common/typical cases and problems\n\n### Community Survey omnibus {-}\n\n\nTypical example: EA Survey^[flesh this out]\n\n\n*Research questions:*\n\n- Current community composition (e.g., 'what share are non-male')\n- Actions taken and level of involvement\n- Retrospective 'how did you get involved?'\n- Relative preferences and attitudes (e.g., longtermist or non-longtermist)\n- Changes in all of this over time\n- Actions vs intentions\n\n\n### Issue-oriented survey of the population {-}\n\nTypical examples: \n\n- EA Pulse, \n- surveys of awareness of EA; \n- attitudes towards long-termism;  \n- polling on animal welfare legislation, etc. \n\n\n*Research questions:*\n\n- Awareness and knowledge of a subject\n- Attitude to an issue\n- Potential voting choices and other behavior \n- Differences across personality, demographic traits, etc.\n- Clustering, dimension reduction, factor analysis: How do responses 'cohere'\n- Differences over time, particularly in response to campaigns (before-after)\n\nData may include:\n\n- Ordered Likert responses and indices\n- Open-response\n- Hypothetical choices among a set of optinos \n- Binary, continuous, other\n\n\n### Naturally occuring behavioral data (signups, donations, etc) {-#natural}\n\nTypical examples:\n\n1.  [All fundraisers for effective charities started on JustGiving during a certain period, with donation amounts](https://daaronr.github.io/just-giving-public-prediction-/codebooks/codebook_uc_fdd_fd.html)\n\nThis data is shared in the current github repo, and read in with code below ^[Not evaluated here atm]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"read in Just Giving data\"}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readr)\n\njg_eff_sample <- readRDS(here::here(\"sample_data\", \"fdd_fd_sample_eff.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(read it in with ` )\n\n2.  Meat and animal product consumption data^[This may be more relevant for the Farmed Animal Welfare team]\n\n3.  A time series^[time series analysis will tend to use distinct approaches] of signups for 80,000 hours newsletter, particularly considering the difference before and after a report in the Guardian newspaper\n\n\nWe share \n\n### Marketing trials/experiments and surveys {-}\n\nThis is distinct from the ['naturally occuring' data](#natural) just mentioned, because we are intervening to 'do or test something' and measure the response.\n\n\nTypical examples: \n\n- EA Market Testing comparison of GWWC Facebook ads to encourage email signup\n- A Prolific survey to helping an EA filmmaker choose a movie title and blurb^[A 'survey experiment' might present a different title to each participant ('between-subject variation'). An alternative approach might present a range of titles to each participant and compare 'within subject'.]\n- An effective charity wants to know how to present their impact information in mail appeals, if at all. They may test this with an actual set of appeals (field experiment, aka 'split test').\n\n\\\n\nResearch questions and goals:\n\n- Baseline response rates and cost per outcome\n- Find 'best approach within a large space' (reinforcement learning)\n- Test different categories of approaches in a limited set ('which works better')\n- Find most promising audiences (profiling)\n- Interaction (tailored messaging, etc.)\n\nData could include\n\n- Attitudinal (Likert) response data\n- Suggestive outcome data (e.g., 'clicks on the web site')\n- Actual 'A/B testing' data for outcomes and responses of interest\n",
