# Monte-Carlo 'Fermi Estimation' Approaches {-#fermi}


'BOTEC': Back of the envelope calculations are central to RP's work

'Fermi estimation' is essentially a more formal approach to this, carefully defining and explaining each element of the 'model' equation.

When we explicitly define (and justify) a probability distribution over each variable in the model, and compute (often through simulation) the overall uncertainty of the outputs (predictions, estimates, etc), we call this "Monte Carlo Fermi Estimation".^[At least David Reinstein thinks this is what it's called]

### Accompanying tools and exercises {-}

> DR: Hubbard provides a set of excel spreadsheets to go through his examples and illustrations, but we have better tools than this. I hope to embed or link a set of these below.


## Monte Carlo Fermi approaches to GiveWell style Cost Effectiveness Analysis

Embedded below, David Reinstein and Sam Nolan explain this approach, advocating its use in GiveWell models and beyond, lay out some building blocks,

... and embed some tools and work-in-progress on this [HERE](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/innovations-in-givewell-esque-ceas/),  also embedded below.

DR: We may want to look for ways to explicitly incorporate and integrate these approaches into our data analysis work in R, etc.
