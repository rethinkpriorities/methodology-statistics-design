# Design: quantitative issues {#expt-quant}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Some quantitative issues

-   'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)
-   Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs
-   Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design
-   Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')

Note that much 'experiment and trial' relevant content is covered in the [surveys](#surveys) section. We will put in placeholders and cross-link.

## 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)

### Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs

-   [Reinstein notes and links here](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/quant-design-power.html#quant_design_power)

-   Elsey: http://www.sequentialtesting.com/

## Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design

### Specifying models, hypotheses, and statistical testing and inference approaches

(Just a brief here, this will be covered in more detail in the sections on statistical inference, testing, and analysis

## Gains from small sample sizes in a Bayesian context

[Jamie's notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTgYMYPuARg8mtFcEg9dZUobObl0YlpZhPZJh34M8UA/edit)

## Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')

[^exp_design_quant-1]

[^exp_design_quant-1]: Note: this will very much overlap the discussion of power analysis for *surveys*. Perhaps we put the simpler introduction there, and the more involved details here?

### Key resources and explainers

('Curate link' tools we found useful)

[Reinstein notes and code](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/power.html)

### See [Power analysis discussion and workflow](#power-workflow)

This is a proposal and tools for a 'path to do' power testing (by Jamie Elsey; David Reinstein will weigh in too). I think this first focuses on a frequentist approach, but it's likely to also introduce a Bayesian approach.
