# Design: quantitative issues {#expt-quant}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Some quantitative issues

- 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)
- Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs
- Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design
- Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')

Note that much 'experiment and trial' relevant content is covered in the [surveys](#surveys) section. We will put in placeholders and cross-link.

## 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)


### Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs

- [Reinstein notes and links here](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/quant-design-power.html#quant_design_power)

- Elsey: http://www.sequentialtesting.com/


## Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design

### Specifying models, hypotheses, and statistical testing and inference approaches

(Just a brief here, this will be covered in more detail in the sections on statistical inference, testing, and analysis

## Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')^[Note: this will very much overlap the discussion of power analysis for *surveys*. Perhaps we put the simpler introduction there, and the more involved details here?

### Key resources and explainers

('Curate link' tools we found useful)

[Reinstein notes and code](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/power.html)



### See ['Rethink_Priorities_Power_analysis_framework_2' in  appendix](#power-workflow)

This is a proposal and tools for a 'path to do' power testing (by Jamie Elsey; David Reinstein will weigh in too). I think this first focuses on a frequentist approach, but it's likely to also introduce a Bayesian approach.

DR: I'm putting it into an appendix to the bookdown for now. We may incorporate much of that into the present section.

An alternative to an 'appendix' is a standalone page which we can link here. This can sometimes be helpful; it allows a different format, may save time on knitting, may allow that other page to be better integrated elsewhere.

But for now, I'll make it a bookdown appendix, to help get us all used to the current format and avoid disagregation.
