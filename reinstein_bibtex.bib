  abstract = {New graduates of elite MBA programs flock to Wall Street during bull markets and start their careers elsewhere when the stock market is weak. Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short-lived. In this paper, I use a survey of Stanford MBAs from the classes of 1960 through 1997 to analyze the relationship between the state of financial market at graduation, initial job placement, and long- term labor market outcomes. Using stock market conditions at graduation as an instrument for first job, I show that there is a strong causal effect of initial placement in investment banking on the likelihood of working on Wall Street anywhere from three to twenty years later. I then measure the investment banking compensation premium relative to other jobs and estimate the additional income generated by anMBA cohort where a higher fraction starts in higher-paid jobs relative to a cohort that starts in lower-paid areas. The results lead to several conclusions. First, random factors play an important role in determining the industries and incomes of members of this high-skill group. Second, there is a deep pool of potential investment bankers in any given Stanford MBA class. During the time these people are in school, factors beyond their control sort them into or out of banking upon graduation. Finally, industry-specificortask-specific human capital appears to be important for young investment bankers.},

  abstract = {Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

We study this question in the context of Germany between 1929 and 1939. Using geographical and temporal variation in radio availability, we show that radio had a significant negative effect on the Nazi electoral support between 1929 and 1932, when political news were slanted against Nazi party. This effect was reversed in just 5 weeks following Hitler's appointment as chancellor and the transfer of control of the radio to the Nazis. Pro-Nazi radio propaganda caused higher vote for the Nazis in March 1933 election. After full consolidation of power, radio propaganda helped the Nazis to enroll new party members and encouraged denunciations of Jews and other open expressions of anti-Semitism. The effect of Nazi propaganda was not uniform. Depending on listeners' priors about the message, propaganda could be very effective or could backfire. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect on the support for anti-Semitic policies in places with historically low anti-Semitism.},

  abstract = {When a public good is congestible, individuals wanting to provide the public good face challenges in forming groups of optimal size, selecting the members of the group, and encouraging members to contribute for the public good. We conduct a series of experiments in which subjects form groups using three different entry and exit rules. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of group size, the level of public good provision, social efficiency, congestion and group stability. We find that entry restriction improves the average earnings for some individuals compared to free entry/exit or restricted exit. For a given group size, individuals under the restricted entry rule contribute more for the provision of the collective good. Also, for a given average contribution level of group members, subjects under the restricted entry rule suffer less from the congestion problem and are better able to form groups of sizes closer to the optimal. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Organizations that aim to increase cooperation can encourage more informed giving by providing more and detailed information to society. However, information provision is costly and organizations have limited resources. Thus, it is important for these organizations to consider the benefits of such provision. This paper investigates the capacity of information to increase public good contributions. We theoretically and experimentally examine the impact of information provision on voluntary contributions to a linear public good with an uncertain marginal per-capita return (MPCR). Uninformed subjects make contribution decisions based only on the expected MPCR (i.e. the prior distribution), while informed subjects observe the realized MPCR before contributing. Using a theoretical model of other-regarding preferences, we find that the impact of information on average contributions crucially depends on the generosity level of the population, modeled as a stochastic increase in the pro-social preferences. In particular, a less generous population substantially increases contributions in response to good news of higher than expected MPCR and reduces contributions relatively little in response to bad news of lower than expected MPCR. The opposite is true for a more generous population. Thus, the overall impact of information is to increase (reduce) average contributions when the population is less (more) generous. We find strong support for these theoretical predictions using a two-stage lab experiment. First, we measure subjects' levels of generosity in the public good game using an online experiment. Then using the data collected in the online experiment, we control for the level of generosity in the lab. Our findings are in line with the theoretical predictions, and suggest that a more targeted information provision may be a successful strategy to improve contributions to public goods.

  abstract = {This paper presents an experimental test of the proposition that government
contributions to public goods, funded by lump-sum taxation, will
completely crowd out voluntary contributions. It is found that crowding-out
is incomplete and that subjects who are taxed are significantly more

  abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality
of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences
of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter
the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social
effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating
to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency.
We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and
controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying
subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two
supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices
actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior.

6. Conclusion

This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality
affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically
alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions.
By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like
pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity
and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising
institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To
get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two
additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving
anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This
allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices
may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more
detail.

We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing
only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the
givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but
not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing
donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each
is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends
to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification
tends to increase contributions.

Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set
a ‘good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period.
We found that the announcement structure has an important effect
on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly,
leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their
contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison
suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to
increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders,
we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in
the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when
information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily
identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to
decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal
with laggards is to make their actions and identities known.

Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising
practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to
remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having
the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their
highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people
the option to report their contributions results in more giving than
required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering
people with the choice to announce their contributions—even though
it is a ‘false' choice that no one would reject—might actually focus
them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that
indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects
in designing this feature of the giving institution.

Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly
shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh,
1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving.
People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category,
and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results
suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has
the potential to significantly increase contributions.

The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions
for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects
that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent,
out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising
institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote
efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by
shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences,
social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of
them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting
the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical
model of fund-raising practices. s},

If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75\%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30\% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70\% to over 100\% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic
behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

  abstract = {When the government gives a gr ant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75\%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30\% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70\% to over 100\% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Our results indicate that the question `which is the fair sex?' has a complicated answerÄîwhen altruism is expensive, women are kinder, but when it is cheap, men are more altruistic. That is, we éfind that the male and female `demand curves for altruism' cross, and that men are more responsive to price changes. Furthermore, men are more likely to be either perfectly selfish or perfectly seleflss, whereas women tend to be `equalitarians' who prefer to share even ... Second, this indicates a need for more attention to sex differences in experimental economics. If differ- ences appear with respect to altruism, they may appear in other behavior as well.23 This, in turn, means that researchers would be wise to assure that their experimental éndings are the result of economic incentives and not of varying sex compositions of their control and treatment groups. There are also potential applications of this result to the real world. If sex differences in altruism are truly present, as sug- gested by evidence from charitable giving and from restaurant tipping, then those who broker in altruism, such as charities and fundraisers, may énd it in their interests to learn more about these differences and to exploit them in their enterprises. For tax policy, sex difference in altruism may also indicate that the inci- dence of the tax deduction to charity may differ by sex as well, with menÄîand the charities they favorÄîgetting a greater share of the subsidy.},

  author = {Andreoni, J and Petrie, R},
  date = {2004},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Public Economics},
  volume = {88},
  pages = {1605--1623},
  abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency. We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior. 6. Conclusion This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions. By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more detail. We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification tends to increase contributions. Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set a ‘good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period. We found that the announcement structure has an important effect on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly, leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders, we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal with laggards is to make their actions and identities known. Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people the option to report their contributions results in more giving than required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering people with the choice to announce their contributions—even though it is a ‘false' choice that no one would reject—might actually focus them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects in designing this feature of the giving institution. Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh, 1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving. People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category, and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has the potential to significantly increase contributions. The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent, out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences, social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical model of fund-raising practices. s},

The effects that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent, out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote efficiency.

  abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency. We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior. 6. Conclusion This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions. By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more detail. We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification tends to increase contributions. Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set a ‘good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period. We found that the announcement structure has an important effect on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly, leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders, we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal with laggards is to make their actions and identities known. Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people the option to report their contributions results in more giving than required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering people with the choice to announce their contributions—even though it is a ‘false' choice that no one would reject—might actually focus them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects in designing this feature of the giving institution. Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh, 1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving. People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category, and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has the potential to significantly increase contributions.

Since many vouchers were allocated by lottery, we use differences in outcomes between lottery winners and losers to assess program effects. Three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to have attended private school, had completed .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8 th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades. The program did not significantly affect dropout rates. Lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. On average, lottery winners increased their educational expenditure by about 70\% of the value of the voucher. Since winners also worked less, they devoted more total resources to education. Compared to an equivalent expansion of the public education system, the voucher program increased annual government educational expenditure by about 24 per winner.

This paper introduces a new test for VAM bias that asks whether VAM estimates accurately predict the achievement consequences of random assignment to specific schools. Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates may be misleading. This finding motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, VAM bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates of VAM parameters. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs are likely to generate substantial achievement gains.

First we discuss the differences in goals, methods and settings between the ML literature and the traditional econometrics and statistics literatures. Then we discuss some specific methods from the machine learning literature that we view as important for empirical researchers in economics. These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, as well as matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treat- ment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

Empirical analysis is complicated by the expected correlation between institutional quality and student wealth, and the possible endogeneity between institutional expenditures on education (one common measure of quality) and the level of alumni support the institution receives. This paper uses a two-stage least squares approach with data on quality and variables correlated with student wealth to address these issues. Quality variables are found to have a positive impact on the average alumni gift, with that impact most significant for private universities and liberal arts colleges. Wealth variables also have a positive impact on the average gift, with the estimated coefficients most significant for public universities. Development effort is very important in determining the level of giving for all three types of institutions.},

  abstract = {Virtually all previous studies of domestic economic redistribution find white Americans to be less enthusiastic about welfare for black recipients than for white recipients. When it comes to foreign aid and international redistribution across racial lines, I argue that prejudice manifests not in an uncharitable, resentful way but in a paternalistic way because intergroup contact is minimal and because of how the media portray black foreigners. Using two survey experiments, I show that white Americans are more favorable toward aid when cued to think of foreign poor of African descent than when cued to think of those of East European descent. This relationship is due not to the greater perceived need of black foreigners but to an underlying racial paternalism that sees them as lacking in human agency. The findings confirm accusations of aid skeptics and hold implications for understanding the roots of paternalistic practices in the foreign aid regime.},

  abstract = {Subjects were less willing to pay for government medical insurance for diseases when the number of people who could not be cured was higher, holding constant the number who could be cured. In a second experiment, willingness to pay (from a hypothetical government windfall) for risk reduction was unaffected by whether the risk was described in terms of percentage or number of lives saved, even though subjects knew that the risks in question differed in prevalence. These results are consistent with the findings of Fetherstonhaugh et al., Jenni and Loewenstein, and others. I suggest that these results can be explained in terms of a general tendency to confuse proportions and differences, a confusion that is analogous to other confusions of quantitative dimensions in children, adults, the news media, and perhaps even the epidemiological literature.},

  abstract = {Multiple sources of funding are becoming increasingly important for charitable organizations. Donations from corporate donors for example account for 25–35\% of charitable income for the largest US charities, across charitable sectors. This note presents some tentative first evidence from a natural field experiment to shed light on how different types of potential donors: individuals, corporates and aristocratically titled individuals, respond to the same fundraising drive. Each donor type was randomly assigned to treatments varying in two dimensions: (i) whether information was conveyed about the existence of an anonymous lead donor, and (ii) how individual donations would be matched by the anonymous lead donor. We find that aristocrats are significantly more likely to respond and that corporates give significantly more than individuals. Treatment effects moreover suggest that (proportional) matching is to be avoided for corporate donors.}

About 30\% of Americans are obese, which is roughly a 100\% increase
from 25 years ago. This study examines the effects of changes in
the racial/ethnic composition and age distribution on the prevalence
of obesity, identifies the portion of the increase in obesity caused
by these changes, and projects the effects of future racial/ethnic
and age changes on obesity using National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey data. Results indicate that racial/ethnic composition changes
and age distribution changes have accounted for about 10\% of the
increase in obesity over the last 25 years. However, future racial/ethnic

different types of players (in this case, nonprofit, co-operative

the factors that have led

Fair Trade to become a mixed-form market and (2) to propose some trails

start by defining briefly Fair Trade, its different dimensions (including
the “fair” quality of the

products) and its organizational landscape, focusing on the distinction
between the pioneer

“Alternative Trading Organizations” and the second-mover companies.
Then, we recall the

theoretical emergence factors for each type of organization (nonprofit,
co-operative and for-

profit) and apply these emergence factors to the context of Fair Trade.
This analysis allows us

to capture the specificities of each type of operator with regard
to Fair Trade and, thus, to have

a better understanding of the competition dynamics in the sector.
The latter analysis includes

elements on ethical imitation, consumers' behaviors, effects on welfare
and the role of the

The estimates reject models that ignore school choice. The statistically preferred estimates suggest that Ph.D.-granting, private universities with well-paid senior faculty and smaller enrollments produce students who have significantly higher earnings later in life. Both the quantity of schooling and the quality of schooling resources are allocated to higher-endowed individuals, which exacerbates preexisting inequality in human capital and biases conventional estimates of school quality effects.},

We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide-range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets.},

  abstract = {he major purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three verbally-mediated variables on financial contributions in a door-todoor charity campaign. The relationship of race to contributions was also observed by using both black and white subjects. One hundred and twenty black and 120 white subjects were randomly assigned to one of 8 verbal appeals in a 2 (High vs. Low Dependency) × 2 (Internal vs. External Causal Locus of Need) × 2 (“it is your social responsibility” vs. “it will make you feel good” Expressed Reason for Giving) factorial design. The solicitor controlled for order effects by varying the sequence of these three variables within each experimental group. Main effects were found for Rae, Causal Locus of Need, and Expressed Reason for Giving: Whites contributed more than blacks, the external locus of need condition produced more giving than the internal condition, and persons who heard the “feel good” reason donated more than those in the “social responsibility” condition. Additionally, a significant Causal Locus of Need × Expressed Reason for Giving interaction was found. The combination of external locus of need and “feel good” was considerably more productive of contributions than the other three combinations. Implications of these results for the helping behavior literature are discussed.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments are an important methodology in economics, especially in the field of behavioral economics. However, it is still debated to what extent results from laboratory experiments can be applied to field settings. One highly important question with respect to the external validity of experiments is whether the same individuals act in experiments as they would in the field. This paper presents evidence on how individuals behave in donation experiments and how the same individuals behave in a naturally occurring decision situation on charitable giving. The results show that behavior in experiments is correlated with behavior in the field. The results are robust to variations in the experimental setting, and the correlation between experimental and field behavior is between 0.25 and 0.4. We discuss whether this correlation should be interpreted as strong or weak and what consequences the findings have for experimental economics.},

  abstract = {Charity could do the most good if every dollar donated went to causes that produced the greatest welfare gains. In line with this proposition, the effective-altruism movement seeks to provide individuals with information regarding the effectiveness of charities in hopes that they will contribute to organizations that maximize the social return of their donation. In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization. Implications for effective altruism are discussed.},

  abstract = {We describe the pension plan features of the states and the largest cities and counties in the U.S. Unlike in the private sector, defined benefit (DB) pensions are still the norm in the public sector. However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee‚Äòs work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers‚Äò need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

This paper compares alternative procedures to deal with multiple measurements through the analysis of synthetic data sets in a Monte Carlo Study and a re-analysis of a published marketing data set. We show that the choice of procedure to deal with multiple measurements is by no means trivial and that it has implications for the results and for the validity of the generalizations derived from meta-analyses. Procedures that use the complete set of measurements outperform procedures that represent each study by a single value, The commonly used method of treating all measurements as independent performs reasonably well but is not preferable. We show that the optimal procedure to account for multiple measurements in meta-analysis explicitly deals with the nested error structure, i.e., at the measurement level and at the study level, which has not been practiced before in marketing meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Researchers need to select high-quality research designs and communicate those designs clearly to readers. Both tasks are difficult. We provide a framework for formally "declaring" the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other "diag-nosands." Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach. for their many contributions to the broader project. The methods proposed in this paper are implemented in an accompanying open-source software package, DeclareDesign (Blair et al. 2018).}

  abstract = {Predictions from the Rejection Sensitivity (RS) model concerning the social causes and consequences of RS were examined in a longitudinal study of 150 middle school students. Peer nominations of rejection, self-report measures of anxious and angry rejection expectations, and social anxiety, social withdrawal, and loneliness were assessed at two time points. Results indicate that peer rejection at Time 1 predicted an increase in anxious and angry expectations of rejection at Time 2, but only for boys. Being liked by peers, irrespective of level of dislike, predicted a reduction in anxious rejection expectations in both boys and girls. Further, anxious expectations of rejection were uniquely predictive of increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Angry expectations of rejection, an established unique predictor of increased aggression, predicted decreased social anxiety. Both anxious and angry expectations predicted increased loneliness, but neither were unique predictors of loneliness. Implications of viewing anxious and angry expectations of rejection as distinct cognitive–affective vulnerabilities for adolescents are discussed.},

  abstract = {As the first systematic attempt to identify the issues involved in the use of large data sets to examine nonprofit surpluses and endowments, this paper provides suggestions for how best to ensure that the data are consistent and useful. We introduce five definitions of nonprofit surplus (the analogue of profit) and identify when researchers should use one in preference to the other. The distinctions are especially important when analyzing endowed organizations because surpluses affect the amount and rate of accumulation of endowment assets. Conversely, an endowment affects how managers and analysts should calculate surplus. Information on IRS 990 reports is incomplete, so we explain how to construct a pro forma endowment portfolio and endowment spending from available data for the purpose of calculating operating surplus of endowed organizations. We argue that researchers doing statistical analyses with large data bases should distinguish between endowed organizations and those without endowments because their financial behavior may differ. To lump them together is likely to distort statistical results. Finally, we discuss practical issues of data cleaning when using data from IRS 990 reports.},

We examine how to move beyond LATE in situations where the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research. Discrete instruments do not give sufficient support to identify the full range of marginal treatment effects (MTE) in the usual local instrumental variable approach. We show how an alternative estimation approach allows identification of richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. One result is that the alternative approach identifies a linear MTE model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another result is that the alternative approach allows identification of a general MTE model under the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. We apply these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used binary instruments to estimate LATEs of family size on child outcomes. We show that the effects of family size are both more varied and more extensive than what the LATEs suggest. Our MTE estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude and even sign, and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.},

Subjects are given a menu of ten charities, with a mix of local and non-local organizations included. We vary whether third-party ratings are displayed on this menu. Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects’ choice of charity is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.},

  abstract = {We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine how third-party ratings impact charity choice and donative behavior, particularly in regards to preferences for local charities. Subjects are given a menu of ten charities, with a mix of local and non-local organizations included. We vary whether third-party ratings are displayed on this menu. Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.},

to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines,
recommender software and sampling tools are allowing customers to
find products outside of their geographic area. The authors also

The article examines the Long Tail from both the supply side and the demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side, the authors point out how e-tailers' expanded, centralized warehousing allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines, recommender software and sampling tools are allowing customers to find products outside of their geographic area. The authors also look toward the future to discuss second order amplified effects of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches.},

  abstract = {We review the emerging literature on climate and conflict. We consider multiple types of human conflict, including both interpersonal conflict, such as assault and murder, and intergroup conflict, including riots and civil war. We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1σ increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4\% and intergroup conflict by 11.3\%. We conclude by highlighting research priorities, including a better understanding of the mechanisms linking climate to conflict, societies’ ability to adapt to climatic changes, and the likely impacts of...},

Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places.

To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly.

of 61 positive affect conditions in which it was possible to generate
an effect-size estimate corresponding to the relative degree of helpfulness
exhibited by positive mood subjects (compared with neutral affect
subjects), judges assessed the contextual levels of variables relevant
to each of the six hypotheses by reading the Method section of each
article. Higher-order partial correlation coefficients were then
calculated to isolate the independent contribution of each of the
theoretically relevant variables to the variation among the 61 effect
sizes. The results support the focus of attention, separate process,
social outlook, and mood maintenance hypotheses, and partially support
the objective self-awareness and concomitance hypotheses. (PsycINFO

  abstract = {Despite a long tradition of using lotteries, raffles and similar mechanisms to fund public goods, there has been little systematic study of the design features of these mechanisms and how the resulting incentives affect the level of provision. Partnering with a charity that provides public goods locally, we conducted a field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to one of four raffle treatments to examine the effectiveness of alternative incentive schemes designed to encourage either participation or “volume.” Contrary to theory which anticipates that gains can be made mostly on volume, our results indicate that significant revenue gains are available on both margins. Indeed, the large opportunity cost of using the standard linear raffle (in which the price per chance to win is fixed) that we find suggests the importance of mechanism design when considering the voluntary provision of public goods.},

This article examines whether or not consumers care about ethical behaviour, and investigates the effect of good and bad ethical conduct on consumer purchase behaviour. Through focus group discussions it becomes clear that although we are more sophisticated as consumers today, this does not necessarily translate into behaviour which favours ethical companies and punishes unethical firms. The article concludes by some thoughts on how marketers might encourage consumers to engage in positive purchase behaviour in favour of ethical marketing.},

We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously—thereby enabling comparative evaluation—they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

  abstract = {This book series reflects the recent rapid growth in the development and application of R, the programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is now widely used in academic research, education, and industry. It is constantly growing, with new versions of the core software released regularly and more than 5,000 packages available. It is difficult for the documentation to keep pace with the expansion of the software, and this vital book series provides a forum for the publication of books covering many aspects of the development and application of R. The scope of the series is wide, covering three main threads: • Applications of R to specific disciplines such as biology, epidemiology, genetics, engineering, finance, and the social sciences. • Using R for the study of topics of statistical methodology, such as linear and mixed modeling, time series, Bayesian methods, and missing data. • The development of R, including programming, building packages, and graphics. The books will appeal to programmers and developers of R software, as well as applied statisticians and data analysts in many fields. The books will feature detailed worked examples and R code fully integrated into the text, ensuring their usefulness to researchers, practitioners and students.},

In addition to the standard categories of laboratory and field experiments, we suggest a new category: "extra-laboratory experiments." These are experiments that have the same spirit as laboratory experiments, but are conducted in a non-standard manner. We also suggest some organizing principles to distinguish amongst the three types of experiments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We survey existing work on these topics within economics and discuss the evidence suggesting that publication bias, inability to replicate, and specification searching remain widespread in the discipline. We next discuss recent progress in this area, including through improved research design, study registration and pre-analysis plans, disclosure standards, and open sharing of data and materials, drawing on experiences in both economics and other social sciences. We discuss areas where consensus is emerging on new practices, as well as approaches that remain controversial, and speculate about the most effective ways to make economics research more credible in the future.

Many workers do not participate in their employers' supplemental retirement savings programs, even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching contributions.

Governmental bodies, think tanks, and corporations around the world employ teams of experimental researchers to answer their most pressing questions. For their part, in the past two decades academics have begun to more actively partner with organizations to generate data via field experimentation. While this revolution in evidence- based approaches has served to deepen the economic science, recently a credibility crisis has caused even the most ardent experimental proponents to pause. This study takes a step back from the burgeoning experimental literature and introduces 12 actions that might help to alleviate this credibility crisis and raise experimental economics to an even higher level. In this way, we view our “12 action wish list” as discussion points to enrich the field. Eszter}

We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both

observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT
scores. However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by
controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students
applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall
substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There

  author = {Dearden, L},
  date = {1999},
  journaltitle = {IFS Working Papers},
  publisher = {{Institute for Fiscal Studies}},
  abstract = {The paper estimates the returns to education for a cohort of individuals
born in Britain in March 1958 who have been followed since birth
until the age of 33. The data used has a wealth of information on
family background including parental education, social class and
interest shown in the child's education as well as measures of ability.
The nature of our data allows us to directly assess the relative
importance of omitted ability and family background bias as well
as biases arising from measurement error in education qualiÅ£ation
variables which have been found to be important in other studies.
The paper also looks at possible biases arising from compositional
diÄ¥rences between individuals in work and those out of work. This
Ñ£omposition bias' arising from self-selection into employment is
generally ignored in the returns to schooling literature and is why
most studies focus only on men (for whom it is assumed this is much
less of a problem). The paper also examines whether there is evidence
of heterogeneity in the returns to education as well as the impact
of education on gender wage diÄ¥rentials. The paper Å®ds that conventional
OLS estimates, which assume that education is exogenous, are reasonable
estimates of the true causal impact of education on wages. In the
UK it would appear that the eÄ¥cts of measurement error bias and
composition bias directly oÄ³et the countervailing eÄ¥ct of unobserved
ability and family background bias for most qualiÅ£ations. The results
from the paper suggest that conventional OLS estimates of the returns
to education can generally be relied upon for policy decisions. The
paper also Å®ds evidence of heterogeneity in the returns to education
in Britain. The results fromthe paper suggest that individuals undertaking
schooling involving some sort of formal qualiÅ£ation have signiÅ£antly
larger rates of return than individuals who complete the same number
of years of schooling but who obtain no formal qualiÅ£ations. There
is also some evidence that individuals with lower tastes for education,
have signiÅ£antly higher marginal returns to certain education qualiÅ£ations.
We also Å®d that post-school qualiÅ£ations, particularly degree qualiÅ£ations,
play an important role in reducing gender wage diÄ¥rentials. The
data used has a wealth of information on family background including
parental education, social class and interest shown in the child's
education as well as measures of ability. The nature of our data
allows us to directly assess the relative importance of omitted ability
and family background bias as well as biases arising from measurement
error in education qualification variables which have been found
to be important in other studies. The paper also looks at possible
biases arising from compositional differences between individuals
in work and those out of work. This Ñ£omposition bias' arising from
self-selection into employment is generally ignored in the returns
to schooling literature and is why most studies focus only on men
(for whom it is assumed this is much less of a problem). The paper
also examines whether there is evidence of heterogeneity in the returns
to education as well as the impact of education on gender wage differentials.
The paper finds that conventional OLS estimates, which assume that
education is exogenous, are reasonable estimates of the true causal
impact of education on wages. In the UK it would appear that the
effects of measurement error bias and composition bias directly oÄ³et
the countervailing effect of unobserved ability and family background
bias for most qualifications. The results from the paper suggest
that conventional OLS estimates of the returns to education can generally
be relied upon for policy decisions. The paper also finds evidence
of heterogeneity in the returns to education in Britain. The results
fromthe paper suggest that individuals undertaking schooling involving
some sort of formal qualification have significantly larger rates
of return than individuals who complete the same number of years
of schooling but who obtain no formal qualifications. There is also
some evidence that individuals with lower tastes for education, have
significantly higher marginal returns to certain education qualifications.

qualifications, play an important role in reducing gender wage differentials.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of having a leader in a laboratory public bad experiment with five subjects in each group. The control treatment is a standard public bad experiment, while in the leader treatments the design is such that in each group the leader decides first on his or her investment in the public bad. After being informed about the leader's decision, the four ‘followers' in each group make their investment decision. Two treatments of the leadership game are played with each group. In the same-leader-costs treatment, all subjects are confronted with the same costs, while in the no-leader-costs treatment the leader faces no direct costs of acting socially. It is found that followers invest significantly less in the public bad when there is a leader compared with a situation when there is no leader. Comparing the two treatments, we find, moreover, that the leadership effect is somewhat stronger when leaders face the same costs as followers compared with the situation in which leaders bear no costs. Randomly chosen leaders set an example by investing less than average players in a standard public bad game, and leader investments are lowest when the costs of leading are low.},

the socialization production function and for policies focused on

  abstract = {Recent theories endogenize the attitude endowments of individuals, assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other role models. This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling the socialization production function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total effect on children's economic situation.},

First, many articles invoke the Heckit to solve a supposed selection problem associated with masses of zero values in continuous variables, despite the fact that it has been shown elsewhere that no such selection problem exists when modeling observed actual, as opposed to latent potential, outcomes. Second, many applications incorrectly formulate the marginal effect tests in the Heckit and two-part model, thus undermining central conclusions. Finally, many researchers use a t-test of the inverse Mills coefficient to choose between the Heckit and two-part models despite its poor performace; we propose instead an adapted empirical mean square error test.},

  abstract = {A fast-growing market for meta-analytic software is R. Despite the pervasive availability of meta-analytic R packages, only a small number of publications have examined the abilities of these packages (Chen \& Pence, 2013; Neupane, Richer, Bonner, Kibret, \& Beyene, 2014), and no review to date has comprehensively cataloged each package. As such, the purpose of this project is to delineate the scope and breadth of meta-analytic R packages in order to: a) inform the meta-analytic field of the availability of these packages, b) explore the packages’ power and applicability, c) elucidate future areas of greater package need. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of meta-analytic R packages using various aggregators (e.g., CRAN website, Revolution Analytics, Crantastic). The search process yielded 136 potential packages of which 54 provided unique contributions (See online appendix). We coded specific capabilities of each package using a pre-defined codebook (See online appendix). Although the coding process is still ongoing, preliminary results indicated a plethora of traditional functionality (e.g., weighted average calculations, moderator analyses), but few packages for the review stage (i.e., screening or coding) or advanced analyses (i.e., multilevel modeling, graphics). The final results will be available prior to the June conference.},

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

  abstract = {We report the results of a field experiment conducted in conjunction with a mailed fundraising campaign of a nonprofit organization. The experiment is designed to compare the response of donors to subsidies in the form of matching amounts or rebated amounts. Matching subsidies are used by many corporations as an employee benefit; the US federal tax system encourages giving using a rebate subsidy by making donations tax deductible. The design includes a control group and two levels of subsidy of each type. Our main result is that matching subsidies result in larger total donations to charities than rebate subsidies, a result that is qualitatively similar to the lab findings. The estimated price elasticities for the matching subsidy are very similar to (and insignificantly different from) the lab experiments, while rebate subsidies lead to lower contributions in the field than in the lab. Since rebates in the field involve substantial lags and additional complications as compared with the "instant rebates" of the lab, this latter difference is not unexpected. The matching results are an important step in validating lab estimates of responsiveness to subsidies of charitable giving.},

  abstract = {Empirically, the commons are not as tragic as standard theory predicts. The predominant explanation for this finding is conditional cooperation. Yet many real life situations involve insiders, who are directly affected by a dilemma, and outsiders, who may be harmed if the insiders overcome the dilemma. The quintessential illustration is oligopoly. If insiders overcome their dilemma and collude, this inflicts harm on the opposite market side. In our experiment, harm on outsiders significantly reduces conditional cooperation of insiders. We can exclude that this result is driven by inequity aversion, reciprocity or efficiency seeking. Only guilt aversion can rationalize our findings, with guilt being most pronounced if the active insiders not only inflict harm on the outsider, but increase their own payoff at the expense of the outsider.},

  abstract = {Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other. Why? Two reasons seem likely: Either solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections. To examine the experience of connecting to strangers, we instructed commuters on trains and buses to connect with a stranger near them, to remain disconnected, or to commute as normal (Experiments 1a and 2a). In both contexts, participants reported a more positive (and no less productive) experience when they connected than when they did not. Separate participants in each context, however, expected precisely the opposite outcome, predicting a more positive experience in solitude (Experiments 1b and 2b). This mistaken preference for solitude stems partly from underestimating others' interest in connecting (Experiments 3a and 3b), which in turn keeps people from learning the actual consequences of social interaction (Experiments 4a and 4b). The pleasure of connection seems contagious: In a laboratory waiting room, participants who were talked to had equally positive experiences as those instructed to talk (Experiment 5). Human beings are social animals. Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being.

Since the importance of such image concerns is normally unobserved, the answer is theoretically unclear, and corresponding empirical evidence is mixed. To help counter this ambiguity, this paper proposes that the importance of image concerns-such as the desire to appear prosocial and not to appear greedy-relates to individuals' volunteer reputations. Experimental results support this possibility. Individuals with past histories of volunteering are less responsive to image concerns if their histories are public, or if their prosocial tendencies are already known. Consistent with a decreased importance of appearing prosocial, they are less likely to volunteer. Consistent with a decreased importance of not appearing greedy, they are less likely to be discouraged by public incentives.},

We find that the majority (83\%) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash.

While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30\% when compared to giving cash.

  abstract = {Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nconsumers’ financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nfinancial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nstudies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1\% of the variance in\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nfinancial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples.

When students were presented with the information that many others donated to two charitable funds at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, their willingness to contribute increased. This constitutes a first test of social interaction effects in charitable giving in a field experiment. The behavior resulting from conditional cooperation is consistent with at least three theoretical approaches: first, people may want to behave in an appropriate way and to conform to a social norm; second, people have some level of fairness preferences, such as reciprocity; or third, contributions by others may serve as a signal of the quality of the public good, or of the organization that provides the good. Results from previous experiments that attempt to discriminate among the various explanations are ambiguous. Some experimental studies indicate that conformity can explain conditional cooperation better than reciprocal considerations, while others come to the opposite conclusion.

In a phenomenon that has been referred to as psychophysical numbing (PN), Fetherstonhaugh, Slovic, Johnson, and Friedrich (1997) found that participants rated an intervention saving a fixed number of lives to be less worth investing in when more total lives were at risk (i,e,, when saved lives represented a smaller proportion of the total threat or problem). In two new experi-ments, life-valuation correlates of PN responding, as well as manipulations of death salience, accountability, and economics focus, were explored in the context of stu-dents' willingness to support mandatory antilock brake requirements for new cars, PN responding was pervasive, but non-PN responders were clearly distinguished by the greater overall value they placed on saving lives.

  abstract = {New graduates of elite MBA programs flock to Wall Street during bull markets and start their careers elsewhere when the stock market is weak. Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short-lived. In this paper, I use a survey of Stanford MBAs from the classes of 1960 through 1997 to analyze the relationship between the state of financial market at graduation, initial job placement, and long- term labor market outcomes. Using stock market conditions at graduation as an instrument for first job, I show that there is a strong causal effect of initial placement in investment banking on the likelihood of working on Wall Street anywhere from three to twenty years later. I then measure the investment banking compensation premium relative to other jobs and estimate the additional income generated by anMBA cohort where a higher fraction starts in higher-paid jobs relative to a cohort that starts in lower-paid areas. The results lead to several conclusions. First, random factors play an important role in determining the industries and incomes of members of this high-skill group. Second, there is a deep pool of potential investment bankers in any given Stanford MBA class. During the time these people are in school, factors beyond their control sort them into or out of banking upon graduation. Finally, industry-specificortask-specific human capital appears to be important for young investment bankers.},

We present the most important findings from numerous public goods experiments and argue that conditional cooperation (contributions are conditional on other people’s contribution) is a primary motivation for many people to (not) contribute to the public good. We also discuss four experiments that test implications of conditional cooperation. We see these experiments as four behavioral models that can help interpreting naturally occurring phenomena, like charitable giving, work morale, and tax evasion. We conclude by discussing some policy implications of the observed behavioral regularities.},

Individuals may believe that peers will exhaust the matching funds, so their donation isn't pivotal. We develop a theory of how beliefs about peers' donations affect one's likelihood of donation. We test our theory using novel “threshold match” treatments in field and laboratory experiments. One “threshold match” treatment more than doubles the donation rate relative to no match. To understand the mechanism behind this increase, we use a lab study to show that beliefs about peers' donations matter. Our theoretical, lab, and field results combined suggest people are more likely to donate when they believe they are more pivotal to securing matching money. Beliefs about others matter, and they should be taken into account when trying to increase donations.}

  abstract = {Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors—all leaders in the statistics community—introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice. New to the Third Edition Four new chapters on nonparametric modeling Coverage of weakly informative priors and boundary-avoiding priors Updated discussion of cross-validation and predictive information criteria Improved convergence monitoring and effective sample size calculations for iterative simulation Presentations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational Bayes, and expectation propagation New and revised software code The book can be used in three different ways. For undergraduate students, it introduces Bayesian inference starting from first principles. For graduate students, the text presents effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields. For researchers, it provides an assortment of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. Additional materials, including data sets used in the examples, solutions to selected exercises, and software instructions, are available on the book’s web page.},

  abstract = {A function g(X, \$þeta\$) of data and parameters is said to be a pivot or a pivotal quantity if its distribution does not depend on the parameter. The primary example of a pivotal quantity is g(X, µ) = X n − µ S n / √ n (1.1) which has the distribution t(n − 1), when the data X 1 , . . ., X n are i. i. d. Normal(µ, σ 2) and X n = 1 n n i=1 X i (1.2a) S 2 n = 1 n − 1 n i=1 (X i − X n) 2 (1.2b) Pivotal quantities allow the construction of exact confidence intervals, mean-ing they have exactly the stated confidence level, as opposed to so-called " asymp-totic " or " large-sample " confidence intervals which only have approximately the stated confidence level and that only when the sample size is large. An exact confidence interval is valid for any sample size. An asymptotic confidence in-terval is valid only for sufficiently large sample size (and typically one does not know how large is large enough). Exact intervals are constructed as follows. • Find a pivotal quantity g(X, \$þeta\$). • Find upper and lower confidence limits on the pivotal quantity, that is, numbers c 1 and c 2 such that Pr\{c 1 \textbackslash{}textless g(X, \$þeta\$) \textbackslash{}textless c 2 \} = γ (1.3) where γ is the desired confidence coefficient. 1 • Solve the inequalities: the confidence set (usually an interval) is \{ \$þeta\$ ∈ Θ : c 1 \textbackslash{}textless g(X, \$þeta\$) \textbackslash{}textless c 2 \} (1.4) The point is that the probability (1.3) does not depend on the parameter \$þeta\$ by definition of " pivotal quantity. " If g(X, \$þeta\$) were not pivotal, then the probability (1.3) would depend on the unknown true parameter value and could not be calculated. The constants c 1 and c 2 in (1.3) are called critical values. They are obtained from a table for the distribution of the pivotal quantity or from a computer program.}

We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a \$1:\$1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80\% (or 94\%) and total donations by 75\% (or 89\%) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large- scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of "choice- option" defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a "scale-back" effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a lower-bar" effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a "default- distraction" effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a "self- canceling" intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue.

  abstract = {Pension reforms in many countries have resulted in more choice and risk to individuals, decreasing the dependability on State public pensions. However, it is not clear how research has addressed this issue and how much is know about retirement saving decisions. With this paper, we provided two major contributions to the literature on retirement saving. As a starting point, we developed a general chart of retirement saving choices, extending the work of Hurd and Panis (2006). These authors focused exclusively on choices at job change or retirement age and we extended their diagram to all main decisions at each stage of retirement saving, providing a more comprehensive framework. We then used this diagram as the yardstick to perform the systematic review and evaluate the breadth of research in the last 20 years. We found 130 papers and identified the most studied retirement choices and the under- researched areas. Most papers focused on asset allocation, decision to save and contribution rate. Less attention was given to decisions at retirement age and voluntary savings. Furthermore, very few papers studied the psychological and social influences in retirement saving decisions. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

With this paper, we provided two major contributions to the literature on retirement saving. As a starting point, we developed a general chart of retirement saving choices, extending the work of Hurd and Panis (2006). These authors focused exclusively on choices at job change or retirement age and we extended their diagram to all main decisions at each stage of retirement saving, providing a more comprehensive framework. We then used this diagram as the yardstick to perform the systematic review and evaluate the breadth of research in the last 20 years. We found 130 papers and identified the most studied retirement choices and the under- researched areas. Most papers focused on asset allocation, decision to save and contribution rate. Less attention was given to decisions at retirement age and voluntary savings. Furthermore, very few papers studied the psychological and social influences in retirement saving decisions. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

to informational conditions,

but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish
between three leading

explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous

to think of her as fair-

minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself
that way, and 3) beliefs-based

altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person
feel. I present a model

in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer,
which can correspond to each

of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations
using the model's predictions

about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either
by the dictator's choice

or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's
choice lowers the frequency

of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based
altruism. However, I

find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about
how he was treated by a

third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism,
and revealing partial

information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant
the recipient's information

about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving,
suggesting social-signaling.

Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing
the likelihood that it

will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the
beliefs of the recipient are

held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests
that the act of giving is

largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed
to the self, or how it makes

  abstract = {A person's willingness to sacrifice for others is highly sensitive to informational conditions, but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish between three leading explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous work has not adequately distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others to think of her as fair- minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself that way, and 3) beliefs-based altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person feel. I present a model in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer, which can correspond to each of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations using the model's predictions about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either by the dictator's choice or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's choice lowers the frequency of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based altruism. However, I find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about how he was treated by a third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism, and revealing partial information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant the recipient's information about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving, suggesting social-signaling. Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing the likelihood that it will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the beliefs of the recipient are held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests that the act of giving is largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed to the self, or how it makes the recipient feel.},

In principle, the sampling design can be modified in later stages or replications to allow for more efficient estimation of causal effects. We consider the design of a two-stage experiment for estimating an average treatment effect when covariate information is available for experimental subjects. We use data from the first stage to choose a conditional treatment assignment rule for units in the second stage of the experiment. This amounts to choosing the propensity score, the conditional probability of treatment given covariates. We propose to select the propensity score to minimize the asymptotic variance bound for estimating the average treatment effect. Our procedure can be implemented simply using standard statistical software and has attractive large-sample properties.},

of men. It is important to know what the return on educational investments
might be since a high return implies that there might be too little

been attempting to unravel the simultaneous relationship between
schooling and wages. That is, wages depend on schooling since schooling
enhances human capital, but schooling decisions depend on wages for
one or more of a number of reasons - for example, individuals will
invest in more schooling the greater is the return to that schooling.
Traditional estimates of the return to an additional year of schooling
in the UK suggest that this is in of the order of 7\%. However, the
results here suggest much larger figures - perhaps in the order of
20\%. We use a large sample of UK males to address the potential endogeneity
of schooling. By exploiting the experimental nature of two changes
in the minimum school leaving age to uncover the effect of an exogenous
increase in schooling on wages. Our results confirm recent US work.
For example, Card (1993) and Butcher and Case (1994) suggest that
the estimates of schooling returns using such methods are almost
double that of simple least squares methods. However, the results
here provide much greater precision than has previously been the

  abstract = {Recent attempts to measure altruism toward other players or charities
suffer from a potential confound: the act of giving is typically
correlated with the size of the pie left on the experimenter's table.
Altruistic acts could thus be more generous if subjects prefer that
monies go toward other players, or charities, than be left on the
table. On the other hand, revealed altruism could be lower if subjects
are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward
the agent to whom they are being asked to give. We demonstrate this
point with simple laboratory experiments that derive from popular
recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized
confound, with revealed altruism dependent upon who is specified
as the residual claimant.},

suffer from a potential confound: the act of giving is typically
correlated with the size of the pie left on the experimenter's table.
Altruistic acts could thus be more generous if subjects prefer that
monies go toward other players, or charities, than be left on the
table. On the other hand, revealed altruism could be lower if subjects
are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward
the agent to whom they are being asked to give. We demonstrate this
point with simple laboratory experiments that derive from popular
recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized
confound, with revealed altruism dependent upon who is specified
as the residual claimant.},

That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health.

Our data link high school and college records to labor market earnings from federal tax forms. We exploit hundreds of regression discontinuities from the centralized, score-based admissions system to estimate the causal impacts of interest. Returns are positive and significant only among more-selective degrees. Returns are highly heterogeneous by field of study, with large returns in health, law and social science, as well as selective technology and business degrees. We find small to negative returns in arts, humanities and education degrees. We do not find evidence that vocational curriculum focus increases returns for less selective degrees. We do not find differential outcomes for students coming from low- versus high-socioeconomic backgrounds admitted to selective degrees.},

This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on instrumental variable estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework.},

While the research has primarily focused on short term behavior, this paper goes beyond this literature to better understand how a short-term intervention, a nudge, can affect subsequent behavior.

We rule out that the nudge has a direct inter-temporal effect and instead show that our findings are consistent with a model of habit formation and moral consistency; that is, altruism begets altruism.

each individual has a veto on the total to be provided (e.g., if
each is responsible for one link of a chain); the latter tends to
arise when there is a single prize of overwhelming importance for
the community, with any individual's effort having a chance of securing
the prize.

In comparison with the standard Summation formula of ordinary public-good
theory, it is shown that underprovision of the public good tends
to considerably moderated when the Weakest-link function is applicable,

where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are
consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions.
It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error
terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators
are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional
methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead,
the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte
Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in
small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are
easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their
asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels

Up until now, no estimator has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations (LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead, the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their asymptotic variances.

Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few "par" colleges, a few "reach" colleges, and a couple of "safety" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts ("achievement-typical" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions ("income-typical" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.},

For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (" good" ) and uncooperative (" bad" ). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This informationhelps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions.

  abstract = {Previous research on gender differences in behavior has led to seemingly contradictory findings. While some authors report that women are more generous than men, others report the opposite relative patterns of behavior. From data generated by 202 subject pairs, we find that women are more sensitive than men to the costs of generous actions when deciding whether or not to be generous. The factors that affect the level of generosity observed in our experiments are reciprocal motivation, the level of money payoffs, and the level of social distance in the experimental protocol. The relatively greater sensitivity of women to the costs of generous behavior can explain some of the apparent inconsistencies of previously-reported findings. ... At first, the results of Andreoni and Vesterlund (2001) appear at odds with our findings but upon closer inspection these findings are actually consistent. In that study, subjects allocated tokens between themselves and a counterpart. The exchange rate at which the tokens could be redeemed for cash was role specific. By varying these exchange rates and the number of tokens, Andreoni and Vesterlund observed decisions across eight distinct budget constraints. Budget \#5 corresponds to the standard dictator game of dividing 10 and for this game they find no gender difference. This treatment is similar to our DS treatment where we also found no significant gender difference. Their budget \#\vphantom\{\}4 corresponds to a standard dictator game involving less money, 6. With this parameterization they report that women are more generous than men, as would be predicted by our results since the payoff level is decreased while holding the social distance and the (absence of) reciprocal motivation constant, annote = NULL, author = Cox, James C and Deck, Cary A, journal = Economic Inquiry, number = 4, pages = 587–598, publisher = Wiley Online Library, title = When are women more generous than men?, volume = 44, year = 2006},

  abstract = {Gneezy and Potters (1997) run an experiment to test the empirical content of Myopic Loss Aversion (MLA). They find that the attractiveness of a risky asset depends upon investors' time horizon: consistently with MLA, individuals are more willing to take risks when they evaluate their investments less frequently. This paper shows that these experimental findings can be accommodated by a standard version of Expected Utility Theory, namely a CRRA functional, provided that, consistently with MLA, we impose narrow bracketing. We use four different datasets to estimate two CRRA and two MLA functionals, together with binary mixture models of all combinations of the competing models. Our econometric exercise supports our theoretical claim on narrow bracketing and finds little evidence of subjects' loss aversion.

They find that the attractiveness of a risky asset depends upon investors' time horizon: consistently with MLA, individuals are more willing to take risks when they evaluate their investments less frequently. This paper shows that these experimental findings can be accommodated by a standard version of Expected Utility Theory, namely a CRRA functional, provided that, consistently with MLA, we impose narrow bracketing. We use four different datasets to estimate two CRRA and two MLA functionals, together with binary mixture models of all combinations of the competing models. Our econometric exercise supports our theoretical claim on narrow bracketing and finds little evidence of subjects' loss aversion.

  abstract = {The true purpose of bitcoin could be to reboot the internet. Right now the cryptocurrency and its cousins, like ethereum, are the province of wild speculation and vast, sudden accumulations of wealth. But as Steven Johnson writes for the New York Times, the underlying blockchain technology could become the new foundation of a secure, decentralized computer network—one where closed services from Facebook, Google, and Amazon exist in a radically different, more accountable form. Or, if those companies miss the boat, perhaps they won't exist at all.},
  annotation = {You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction — say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum — that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of “blocks” of data, that record is called the blockchain. The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening — something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness. the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries.},

  abstract = {We develop a model of reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion where " gain–loss utility " is derived from standard " consumption utility " and the reference point is determined endogenously by the economic environment. We assume that a person's reference point is her rational expectations held in the recent past about outcomes, which are determined in a personal equilibrium by the requirement that they must be consistent with optimal behavior given expec-tations. In deterministic environments, choices maximize consumption utility, but gain–loss utility influences behavior when there is uncertainty. Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase. In within-day labor-supply decisions, a worker is less likely to continue work if income earned thus far is unexpectedly high, but more likely to show up as well as continue work if expected income is high.},

who do not compete against each other. We test this idea in a trust
game where trustors and trustees are rewarded based either on their
absolute performance or on how well they do relative to players from
other dyads. In Experiment 1, we show that competition among trustors
significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases
trustworthiness, but trustors do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment
2, we additionally show that the increase in trust under competition
is caused by a combination of increased risk taking and lower sensitivity
to non-financial concerns specific to trust interactions. Our results
suggest that tournament incentives might have a “blinding effect”
on considerations such as betrayal and inequality aversion.},

  abstract = {When and how should a fundraiser ask for a donation from an individual facing an uncertain bonus income? A standard model of expected utility over outcomes predicts that the individual’s before choice – her ex-ante commitment conditional on her income – will be the same as her choice after the income has been revealed. Deciding “if you win, how much will you donate?” involves a commitment (i) over a donation for a state of the world that may not be realized and (ii) over uncertain income. Models involving reference-dependent utility, tangibility, and self-signaling predict more giving before, while theories of affect predict more giving after. In our online field experiment at a UK university, as well as in our laboratory experiments in Germany, charitable giving was significantly larger in the Before treatment than in the After treatment for male subjects, with a significant gender differential. Lab treatments isolated distinct mechanisms: for men, donations were higher in all treatments where the donation’s collection was uncertain, whether or not the income was known. This supports a (self)-signaling explanation: commitments realized with a lower probability must involve larger amounts to have the same signaling power. Our results are directly relevant to fundraising and volunteer-recruitment strategies, and offer further evidence that we need to exercise caution in applying expected-utility theory in the presence of social preferences},

  abstract = {Abstract: Why do individuals choose different types of post-secondary education, and what are the labor market consequences of those choices? We investigate these questions in the context of Norway's post-secondary education system. Our analysis is based on a generalized Roy model where individuals can choose between multiple fields of study. To overcome the challenge of selection bias, we take advantage of Norway's centralized admission process that covers almost all universities and colleges. This process creates discontinuities which effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different fields of study. From the students' applications, we know their ranking of fields and can therefore construct relevant counterfactuals. Our empirical findings may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, we find that different fields have widely different payoffs. For example, by choosing engineering instead of teaching, individuals more than double the earnings they receive. By comparison, choosing humanities or nursing instead of teaching has little payoff. Second, when disentangling the causal contribution of field of study and institution, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in payoffs to post-secondary education. Third, individuals tend to choose fields in which they have comparative and absolute advantage. In contrast, a choice model with one-factor ability-as-IQ is inconsistent with the pattern of selection we estimate. Our study has important implications for the policy debate over mismatch and market frictions in the supply and demand for post-secondary field of study, and for the literature on how to model and correct for selection bias when there are many unordered alternatives.}

First, we find that different fields have widely different payoffs. For example, by choosing engineering instead of teaching, individuals more than double the earnings they receive. By comparison, choosing humanities or nursing instead of teaching has little payoff. Second, when disentangling the causal contribution of field of study and institution, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in payoffs to post-secondary education. Third, individuals tend to choose fields in which they have comparative and absolute advantage. In contrast, a choice model with one-factor ability-as-IQ is inconsistent with the pattern of selection we estimate. Our study has important implications for the policy debate over mismatch and market frictions in the supply and demand for post-secondary field of study, and for the literature on how to model and correct for selection bias when there are many unordered alternatives.}

  abstract = {Empirical policy research often focuses on causal inference. Since policy choices seem to depend on understanding the counterfactual-what happens with and without a policy-this tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy applications where causal inference is not central, or even necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policy maker facing a drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must deciding whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home? Both decisions could benefit from an empirical duty of rain. But each has different requirements of the estimator. One requires causality: do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing only prediction: is the chance of rain high enough to merit an umbrella? We often focus on rain dance like policy problems. But there are many important policy problems umbrella-like. Not only are these prediction problems neglected, machine learning can help us solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a simple framework that clarifies the distinction between causation and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems; (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social impact; (iv) illustrate how "umbrella" problems are common and important in many important policy domains; and (v) argue that solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also theoretical and economic insights. 1 * Obermeyer: zobermeyer@partners.org. 1 A longer version of this paper-Kleinberg et al. (2015a)-fleshes out each of these points, providing greater detail on the model, the empirical work and a more through summary of machine learning.},

  abstract = {This paper reports new findings on gender differences in altruism. Conducting a natural field experiment (N = 2,164) we study donation behavior in a naturally occurring environment using a matched donation design. Contrary to previous research, we find that reducing the “price of altruism” by increasing matching efficiency has a significantly stronger effect on females than on males.}

However, beyond all those reasons, the wish to help other people, particularly when those people are in need of external help, is the core motivation for charitable giving and helping behavior. Thus, in order to better understand the psychological motivation of charitable giving, it is important to explore the factors that may increase or decrease the fundamental wish to extend help. One of the main factors that affects the wish to aid is the characteristics of the target—the recipient of the help. Why do some targets elicit outpourings of sympathy and aid, while other targets do not? In this chapter we review experimental and theoretical work on the effect of victims identifiability on charitable giving.

I bound and estimate average treatment effects for always takers and never takers by extending marginal treatment effect methods. I use these methods to separate selection from treatment effect heterogeneity, generalizing the comparison of OLS to LATE. Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, I find that the treatment effect of insurance on emergency room utilization decreases from always takers to compliers to never takers. Previous utilization explains a large share of the treatment effect heterogeneity. Extrapolations show that other expansions could increase or decrease utilization.},

  abstract = {A dynamic model of insider trading with sequential auctions, structured to resemble a sequential equilibrium, is used to examine the informational content of prices, the liquidity characteristics of a speculative market, and the value of private information to an insider. The model has three kinds of traders: a single risk neutral insider, random noise traders, and competitive risk neutral market makers. The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camou- flage which conceals his trading from market makers. As the time interval between auctions goes to zero, a limiting model of continuous trading is obtained. In this equilibrium, prices follow Brownian motion, the depth of the market is constant over time, and all private information is incorporated into prices by the end of trading.}

discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {A number of experimental studies have documented that financial rewards
discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study develops theory and uses a door-to-door fund-raising field experiment to explore the economics of charity. We approached nearly 5000 households, randomly divided into four experimental treatments, to shed light on key issues on the demand side of charitable fund-raising. Empirical results are in line with our theory: in gross terms, the lotteries raised more money than the voluntary contributions treatments. Interestingly, in terms of both maximizing current contributions and inducing participation, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in female solicitor physical attractiveness is similar to that of the lottery incentive.}

  abstract = {This paper empirically assesses the wage effects of the Job Corps program, one of the largest federally funded job training programs in the U.S. Even with the aid of a randomized experiment, the impact of a training program on wages is difficult to study because of sample selection, a pervasive problem in applied microeconometric research. Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition. © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.}

locations of a large eastern city, and Ss differed in ethnic and
socioeconomic characteristics. As in the earlier investigation, "good
mood" was induced by the discovery of a dime in the coin return of
a public telephone. The dependent measure in the present experiments,
however, was willingness to mail a sealed and addressed letter which
had been left at the telephone, apparently by accident. Both stamped

those finding a dime would be more helpful, even though all Ss saw

  abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommen-dations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor. A recent confluence of factors, including high-profile cases of research fraud by psychologists, questions regarding the depend-ability and replicability of scientific results, and concerns about the use of questionable research practices, has contributed to the emergence of a new movement to improve the scientific integrity of psychological science (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Funder et al., The primary goals of this movement, which I will refer to as the research dependability movement, are to illuminate problems in contempo-rary psychological science that undermine the integrity of empir-ical findings and to present potential solutions for how to address these problems. The movement appears to be gaining momentum as indicated by changes in the editorial policies of various prom-inent journals that appear designed to promote greater dependabil-ity in published findings (for several examples, see editorial pol-icies at Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Psychological Science). Increasing support for the movement has spawned numerous commentaries that seek to address the dependability problem (e.g., Ledgerwood, 2014a, 2014b, and accompanying special section articles; Makel, 2014, and accompanying special section articles; Pashler \& Wangenmakers, 2012, and accompanying special section articles; Spellman, 2012, and accompanying special section articles). Although several attempts to integrate solutions into comprehensive lists have been attempted (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cumming, 2014; Funder et al., 2014), the number of proposed solutions and recommendations is growing quite large. A sampling of such recommendations based on a casual reading of various research dependability commentaries is provided in Table 1. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations for improving re-search dependability has created several problems. First, the high number of recommendations is overwhelming for those hoping to implement meaningful changes in their own research activities or training programs. Second, the high number of recommendations makes it challenging to coordinate meaningful responses within and across constituencies that make up psychological science (i.e., researchers, journal editors and reviewers, administrators of re-search support institutions, and educators). Together, these prob-lems are fairly obvious in their potential impact: too many recom-mendations make it difficult to address research dependability challenges in a manner that is uniform among individuals within and across different constituencies. However, a third less obvious problem exists with the numerous research dependability recommendations. Specifically, many are based on concerns that arise from two earlier movements in psychological methodology and statistics that rest on somewhat contradictory assumptions. When these recommendations are un-critically blended under the research dependability umbrella, they may promote conflicting behaviors that undermine the very goals the dependability movement seeks to achieve. Given these problems, the purpose of the present commentary is to arrive at a concise list of core recommendations to improve the integrity of psychological science. This process was based on three guiding principles. First, and most importantly, core recommen-dations should be internally consistent in that they should lead to nonconflicting outcomes in addressing research dependability is-sues. Second, the number of recommendations should be small and},

  abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommen-dations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor. A recent confluence of factors, including high-profile cases of research fraud by psychologists, questions regarding the depend-ability and replicability of scientific results, and concerns about the use of questionable research practices, has contributed to the emergence of a new movement to improve the scientific integrity of psychological science (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Funder et al., The primary goals of this movement, which I will refer to as the research dependability movement, are to illuminate problems in contempo-rary psychological science that undermine the integrity of empir-ical findings and to present potential solutions for how to address these problems. The movement appears to be gaining momentum as indicated by changes in the editorial policies of various prom-inent journals that appear designed to promote greater dependabil-ity in published findings (for several examples, see editorial pol-icies at Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Psychological Science). Increasing support for the movement has spawned numerous commentaries that seek to address the dependability problem (e.g., Ledgerwood, 2014a, 2014b, and accompanying special section articles; Makel, 2014, and accompanying special section articles; Pashler \& Wangenmakers, 2012, and accompanying special section articles; Spellman, 2012, and accompanying special section articles). Although several attempts to integrate solutions into comprehensive lists have been attempted (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cumming, 2014; Funder et al., 2014), the number of proposed solutions and recommendations is growing quite large. A sampling of such recommendations based on a casual reading of various research dependability commentaries is provided in Table 1. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations for improving re-search dependability has created several problems. First, the high number of recommendations is overwhelming for those hoping to implement meaningful changes in their own research activities or training programs. Second, the high number of recommendations makes it challenging to coordinate meaningful responses within and across constituencies that make up psychological science (i.e., researchers, journal editors and reviewers, administrators of re-search support institutions, and educators). Together, these prob-lems are fairly obvious in their potential impact: too many recom-mendations make it difficult to address research dependability challenges in a manner that is uniform among individuals within and across different constituencies. However, a third less obvious problem exists with the numerous research dependability recommendations. Specifically, many are based on concerns that arise from two earlier movements in psychological methodology and statistics that rest on somewhat contradictory assumptions. When these recommendations are un-critically blended under the research dependability umbrella, they may promote conflicting behaviors that undermine the very goals the dependability movement seeks to achieve. Given these problems, the purpose of the present commentary is to arrive at a concise list of core recommendations to improve the integrity of psychological science. This process was based on three guiding principles. First, and most importantly, core recommen-dations should be internally consistent in that they should lead to nonconflicting outcomes in addressing research dependability is-sues.

  abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k) savings behavior. We have two key findings. First, 401(k) participation is significantly higher under automatic enrollment. Second, a substantial fraction of 401(k) participants hired under automatic enrollment retain both the default contribution rate and fund allocation even though few employees hired before automatic enrollment picked this particular outcome. This `default' behavior appears to result from participant inertia and from employee perceptions of the default as investment advice. These findings have implications for the design of 401(k) savings plans as well as for any type of Social Security reform that includes personal accounts over which individuals have control. They also shed light more generally on the importance of both economic and noneconomic (behavioral) factors in the determination of individual savings behavior.},

At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists. These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus. If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters. Our main finding is that the location in the alphabet - and hence, a marginal personal solicitation - has a strong effect on the probability of making a gift. A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15.

An increased price of giving results in a lower likelihood of a project being funded. We also calculate the price elasticity of giving, finding estimates between -0.8 and -2.

reaction to a monetary outcome is not a simple function of the utility
of that outcome. Emotional responses also depend on probabilities
and unobtained outcomes. Unexpected outcomes have greater emotional
impact than expected outcomes. Furthermore, any given outcome is
less pleasant if an unobtained outcome is better. The authors propose
an account of emotional experiences associated with outcomes of decisions
called decision affect theory. Decision affect theory incorporates
utilities, expectations, and counterfactual comparisons into hedonic
responses. Finally, the authors show that choices between risky options
can be described as the maximization of expected emotional experiences,

  abstract = {The traditional studies of income distribution, a field with which economists are becoming increasingly concerned, must be described as basically sociological. The ascendancy of the human capital approach can be viewed as a reaction of economists to this non-economic, though certainly not irrelevant, tradition. In stressing the role played by individual and family optimizing decisions in human capital investments, important aspects of income determination are brought back within the mainstream of economic theory and within the power of its analytical and econometric tools. Human capital is not the only element of choice in the analysis of income distribution . Nevertheless, it appears that the subject of human capital investments lends itself to a more systematic and comprehensive analysis of wage differentials, than each of the other factors. The following is a description of research in the distribution of labor incomes in which human capital theory serves as an organizing principle. It is, in part, a sequel to my 1970 survey and, in part, a report of ongoing research of my own and of others.},

I quantify how much the consumption decisions of individuals depend
on information they receive from their peers, when quality is ex
ante uncertain. In the presence of social learning, we should see
different box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening
weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature
of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the
number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects
the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners.
Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First,
sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening
weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected
appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week
1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality,
further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small
for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies
for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise
is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers
do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal
to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears
to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting
for 32\% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This
implies the existence of a large “social multiplier” such that the
elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the

Choice of fund was not associated with observable measures of fund performance, but was strongly affected by the employees' social environment. Exploiting within-department variation in peer groups, we find that savings decisions were strongly influenced by the choices of co-workers from the same ethnic group. Interviews also point to the influence of non-professional colleagues.}

We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.},

The results show that consumers” ethical beliefs are determined, in part, by who is at fault in the unethical behavior (the seller or the buyer). The results also indicate that those with a more positive attitude toward business are less likely to engage in questionable consumer practices, but one”s attitudes toward salespeople, the government and people in general arenot related to the consumer”s ethical beliefs.},

  abstract = {Conclusion On the whole the evidence lends support to the hypothesis that social pressure affects the level of charitable contributions. We find, however, that the form of the pressure is an important determinant of the size of health contributions. Personal forms of solicitation appear to increase contributions, relative to impersonal forms such as media advertisements and mail campaigns. Within the class of personal solicitations, we find that pressure to give which is exerted by friends is more effective than requrests by strangers. Limited evidence was also found that some workplace relationships result in more effective fund-raising when compared to solicitations by strangers.},

  abstract = {This article develops a new model of altruism called impact philanthropy. An impact philanthropist is someone who wants to personally ‘make a difference.' While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

We investigate heterogeneity in returns according to parental education and the student's financial situation.

Our main con-tribution is to explain this phenomenon through a signalling model, where foregoing prestige through anonymity signals the charity's qual-ity.},

Using a nationally representative US sample, the present study examined whether perceived likelihood of developing cancer and worry about cancer were associated with reports of avoiding visits to one's doctor, in respondents under and over age 50. Cancer worry, but not perceived risk of cancer, predicted doctor avoidance in respondents aged 50 and older, whereas the opposite pattern held for respondents under age 50. Moreover, in respondents aged 50 and older, cancer worry and perceived cancer risk interacted such that cancer worry was linked to doctor avoidance only when respondents also perceived a high likelihood of cancer. The latter result is consistent with the notion that worry may motivate information seeking when people expect information to dispel worry and information avoidance when the information is seen as highly likely to confirm one's fears. Findings suggest a need for communication strategies that can influence worry and perceived risk differentially. Research should also assess the effectiveness of other behavioral strategies (e.g., automatic scheduling of appointments) as a means for reducing doctor avoidance.},

  abstract = {A fast-growing market for meta-analytic software is R. Despite the pervasive availability of meta-analytic R packages, only a small number of publications have examined the abilities of these packages (Chen \& Pence, 2013; Neupane, Richer, Bonner, Kibret, \& Beyene, 2014), and no review to date has comprehensively cataloged each package. As such, the purpose of this project is to delineate the scope and breadth of meta-analytic R packages in order to: a) inform the meta-analytic field of the availability of these packages, b) explore the packages’ power and applicability, c) elucidate future areas of greater package need. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of meta-analytic R packages using various aggregators (e.g., CRAN website, Revolution Analytics, Crantastic). The search process yielded 136 potential packages of which 54 provided unique contributions (See online appendix). We coded specific capabilities of each package using a pre-defined codebook (See online appendix). Although the coding process is still ongoing, preliminary results indicated a plethora of traditional functionality (e.g., weighted average calculations, moderator analyses), but few packages for the review stage (i.e., screening or coding) or advanced analyses (i.e., multilevel modeling, graphics). The final results will be available prior to the June conference.},

  author = {Poterba, James},
  date = {2004},
  institution = {{National Bureau of Economic Research}},
  abstract = {A number of financial market analysts have argued that the aging of the "Baby Boom" cohort contributed to the rise U.S. asset values during the 1990s, and that asset prices will decline when this group reaches retirement age and begins to draw down its wealth. This paper explores the importance of changing demographic structure for asset returns, asset prices, and the composition of household balance sheets in the United States. Standard models suggest that equilibrium returns on financial assets will vary in response to changes in population age structure. While the direction of the effect of demographic changes is not controversial, the quantitative importance of such changes for financial markets is open to debate. The paper presents several strands of empirical evidence that bear on this issue. First, it describes current age-specific patterns of asset holding in the United States, and finds that asset holdings rise sharply when households are in their 30s and 40s. Aside from the automatic decline in the value of defined benefit pension assets as households age, however, other financial assets decline only gradually during retirement. When these data are used to project asset demands in light of the future age structure of the U.S. population, they do not show a sharp decline in asset demand between 2020 and 2050. This finding calls into question the "asset market meltdown" view. Second, the paper considers the historical association between population age structure and real returns on Treasury bills, long-term government bonds, and corporate stock. The evidence suggests only modest effects, if any, of a changing demographic mix. Statistical tests based on the few effective degrees of freedom in the historical record of age structure and asset returns have limited power to detect such effects. There is a stronger historical correlation between asset levels, as measured for example by the price-dividend ratio, and summary measures of the population age structure. Once again, however, the results are sensitive to choices about econometric specification. These empirical findings provide modest support, at best, for the view that asset prices could decline as the share of households over the age of 65 increases.},

We employ an experimental design with three treatments that vary the recipient (experimenter, charity) and amount passed (fixed, varying). We find giving to the experimenter not to be significantly different from giving to a charity, when the amount the subject donates crowds out the amount donated by the experimenter such that the charity always receives a fixed amount. This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.},

Sequential moves result in a larger provision of the public good, because the follower mimics the action of the leader, and in accounting for this response the leader chooses to contribute when it is efficient to do so. An experimental investigation of the game shows that the donors predominantly choose to contribute sequentially, and that the resulting contributions are larger than those of the simultaneous-move game. Although the gain from sequential moves is smaller when the sequence is set exogenously, our results suggest that the involved parties would benefit from having sequential moves imposed upon them.},

Potential explanations are that these announcements cause future donors to increase their contributions, either because they want to reciprocate the generosity of earlier donors, or because the initial contributions are seen as a signal of the charity's quality. Using experimental methods we investigate these two hypotheses. When only the first donor is informed of the public good's quality, subjects not only copy the initial contribu- tion, but the first donor also correctly anticipates this response. While this result is consistent with both the signaling and the reciprocity explanations, the latter is unlikely to be the driving force. The reason is that announcements have no effect on contribution levels when the quality of the public good is common knowledge. Thus our results provide strong support for the signaling hypothesis.

  abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis synthesizes a body of research investigating a common research question. Outcomes from meta-analyses provide a more objective and transparent summary of a research area than traditional narrative reviews. Moreover, they are often used to support research grant applications, guide clinical practice and direct health policy. The aim of this article is to provide a practical and nontechnical guide for psychological scientists that outlines the steps involved in planning and performing a meta-analysis of correlational datasets. I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes. I also emphasise the importance of meta-analysis protocols and pre-registration to improve transparency and help avoid unintended duplication. An improved understanding this tool will not only help scientists to conduct their own meta-analyses but also improve their evaluation of published meta-analyses.},

I develop a commodity network framework that builds on the commodity chain tradition, integrating insights from cultural studies, actor–network theory, and conventions approaches. This framework illuminates how material and ideological relations are negotiated across production and consumption arenas. In the case of Fair Trade, progressive ideas and practices related to trust, equality, and global responsibility are intertwined with traditional commercial and industrial conventions. As I demonstrate, the negotiation of these divergent conventions shortens the social distance between Fair Trade coffee consumers and producers. I conclude that by re–linking consumers and producers, commodity network analysis provides a robust entré for academic inquiry and engagement in alternative food politics.},

The experiment randomized listeners into nine treatment groups, each of which received a different level of audio advertising interrupting their music listening, with the highest treatment group receiving more than twice as many ads as the lowest treatment group. By keeping consistent treatment assignment for 21 months, we can see that the long-term effects of a change in " ad load, " or number of ads per hour, take over a year to be fully realized. We estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear, with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour. We also show the negative impact on the number of days listened and on the probability of listening at all in the final month. Using an experimental design that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour and the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that neither makes any difference to listeners except for the way they increase the total number of ads per hour. Lastly, we find increased ad load causes a significant increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora, particularly among older listeners.}

Using the timing of the reviews by two popular movie critics, Siskel and Ebert, relative to opening weekend box office revenue, we apply a difference-in-differences approach to circumvent the problem of spurious correlation. After purging the spurious correlation, the measured influence effect is smaller though still detectable.

  abstract = {This paper defines, discusses, and measures "expenditure substitution" in charitable giving. Motivated by a model of conditional demand, I consider the extent to which a "temporary shock" that increases an individual's donation to one cause by a particular amount displaces her gifts to other charitable causes. I use the 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS, the first data set of its kind, to identify this. Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others. However, many of the correlations between the residuals after fixed-effects regressions are negative and significant, particularly for larger donors and for certain categories of charitable giving. Given plausible econometric assumptions, the negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution. Overall, these results suggest heterogeneous motivations for giving: small givers may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals while larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.

A supplier’s investment reduces the retailer’s cost or boosts the final product’s quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier’s incentive compatibility constraint.

In the context of a charitable giving experiment we decompose this into two common artifacts of the laboratory: the intangibility of money (or experimental currency units) promised on a computer screen relative to cash in hand, and the distinct treatment of random "windfall" gains relative to earned money. While both effects are found to be significant in non-parametric tests, the former effect, which has been neglected in previous studies, has a stronger impact on total donations, while the latter effect has a greater impact on the probability of donating. These results have clear implications for experimental design, and also suggest that the availability of more abstract payment methods may increase other-regarding behavior in the field. © 2011 Economic Science Association.},

  abstract = {Several papers have documented that when subjects play with standard laboratory "endowments" they make less self-interested choices than when they use money they have either earned through a laboratory task or brought from outside the lab. In the context of a charitable giving experiment we decompose this into two common artifacts of the laboratory: the intangibility of money (or experimental currency units) promised on a computer screen relative to cash in hand, and the distinct treatment of random "windfall" gains relative to earned money. While both effects are found to be significant in non-parametric tests, the former effect, which has been neglected in previous studies, has a stronger impact on total donations, while the latter effect has a greater impact on the probability of donating. These results have clear implications for experimental design, and also suggest that the availability of more abstract payment methods may increase other-regarding behavior in the field. © 2011 Economic Science Association.},

  abstract = {This paper defines, discusses, and measures "expenditure substitution" in charitable giving. Motivated by a model of conditional demand, I consider the extent to which a "temporary shock" that increases an individual's donation to one cause by a particular amount displaces her gifts to other charitable causes. I use the 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS, the first data set of its kind, to identify this. Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others. However, many of the correlations between the residuals after fixed-effects regressions are negative and significant, particularly for larger donors and for certain categories of charitable giving. Given plausible econometric assumptions, the negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution. Overall, these results suggest heterogeneous motivations for giving: small givers may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals while larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.

Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders.We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking." © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.},

We observe for all three pricing tasks that subjects' willingness to pay for the lottery is significantly higher than other subjects' willingness to pay for the lottery's worse outcome.},

This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum p value within the initial sample such that the dataset would be augmented. With one round of augmentation, Type I error inflation maximizes at .0975 with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical value to allow augmentation while maintaining p {$<$} .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, paugmented , that represents the magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation.

  abstract = {Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes
an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991).
Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports,
consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions
given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals,
among others. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study
competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically,
we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition
fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather
than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are
the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers
and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing
strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of
the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested
in understanding what is specific about competition in information
markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences
and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential
for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information.
To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic
model that consists of two firms selling information to a population
of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for
the quality of information. The most important features of the model
are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are
modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal
mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness
constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common
knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the
distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the
firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more
accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy
of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by
the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers'
utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on
their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price
they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms
simultaneously price their information products. The main finding
of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive
structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition
changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional
products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements
in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or
the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute
space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively
with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition
behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information,
consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase
from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when
the reliability of information is low and the sources of information
are independent. Under such conditions information products tend
to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is

  abstract = {Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes
an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991).
Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports,
consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions
given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals,
among others. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study
competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically,
we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition
fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather
than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are
the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers
and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing
strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of
the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested
in understanding what is specific about competition in information
markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences
and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential
for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information.
To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic
model that consists of two firms selling information to a population
of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for
the quality of information. The most important features of the model
are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are
modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal
mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness
constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common
knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the
distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the
firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more
accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy
of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by
the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers'
utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on
their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price
they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms
simultaneously price their information products. The main finding
of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive
structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition
changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional
products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements
in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or
the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute
space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively
with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition
behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information,
consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase
from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when
the reliability of information is low and the sources of information
are independent. Under such conditions information products tend
to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is
relatively mild. In the opposite case, when information is reliable
and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied
after consulting a single source. In this case, information products
are substitutes and sellers tend to undercut one another's prices
to induce consumers to choose their brand. Understanding this discontinuity
in competitive structures has important implications for decision
makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product

Our standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data. We solve every household's decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992. Ours is the first study to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample. The results, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking we find that the model is capable of accounting for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.},

We divided the lottery-admitted group into, respectively, students who had not participated and students who had been rejected in the multifaceted selection process. We used ancova modelling, logistic regression and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests and controlled for gender and cohort.: The top pre-university grade group achieved higher knowledge test scores and more Year 1 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). This group received the highest possible professionalism score more often than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process (p  0.05). The group of students accepted in the multifaceted selection process obtained higher written test scores than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated (p  0.05) and achieved the highest possible professionalism score more often than both lottery-admitted groups. The lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process earned fewer Year 1 and 2 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). Dropout rates differed among the groups (p  0.05), but correction for multiple comparisons rendered all pairwise differences non-significant.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: A top pre-university grade point average was the best predictor of performance. For so-called non-academic performance, the multifaceted selection process was efficient in identifying applicants with suitable skills.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research indicates that certain personality traits relate to performance in the medical profession. Yet, personality testing during selection seems ineffective. In this study, we examine the extent to which different medical school selection processes call upon desirable personality characteristics in applicants.: 1019 of all 1055 students who entered the Dutch Bachelor of Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were included in this study. Students were admitted based on either top pre-university grades (n = 139), acceptance in a voluntary multifaceted selection process (n = 286), or lottery weighted for pre-university GPA. Within the lottery group, we distinguished between students who had not participated (n = 284) and students who were initially rejected (n = 310) in the voluntary selection process. Two months after admission, personality was assessed with the NEO-FFI, a measure of the five factor model of personality. We performed ANCOVA modelling with gender as a covariate to examine personality differences between the four groups.: The multifaceted selection group scored higher on extraversion than all other groups(p0.01), higher on conscientiousness than both lottery-admitted groups(p0.01), and lower on neuroticism than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the voluntary selection process. The latter group scored lower on conscientiousness than all other groups(p0.05) and lower on agreeableness than the multifaceted selection group and the top pre-university group(p0.01).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Differences between the four admission groups, though statistically significant, were relatively small. Personality scores in the group admitted through the voluntary multifaceted selection process seemed most fit for the medical profession. Personality scores in the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in this process seemed least fit for the medical profession. It seems that in order to select applicants with suitable personalities, an admission process that calls upon desirable personality characteristics is beneficial.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to: (i) analyse whether students admitted to one medical school based on top pre-university grades, a voluntary multifaceted selection process, or lottery, respectively, differed in study performance; (ii) examine whether students who were accepted in the multifaceted selection process outperformed their rejected peers, and (iii) analyse whether participation in the multifaceted selection procedure was related to performance.: We examined knowledge test and professionalism scores, study progress and dropout in three cohorts of medical students admitted to the University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (n = 1055). We divided the lottery-admitted group into, respectively, students who had not participated and students who had been rejected in the multifaceted selection process. We used ancova modelling, logistic regression and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests and controlled for gender and cohort.: The top pre-university grade group achieved higher knowledge test scores and more Year 1 course credits than all other groups (p 0.05). This group received the highest possible professionalism score more often than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process (p 0.05). The group of students accepted in the multifaceted selection process obtained higher written test scores than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated (p 0.05) and achieved the highest possible professionalism score more often than both lottery-admitted groups. The lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process earned fewer Year 1 and 2 course credits than all other groups (p 0.05). Dropout rates differed among the groups (p 0.05), but correction for multiple comparisons rendered all pairwise differences non-significant.\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: A top pre-university grade point average was the best predictor of performance. For so-called non-academic performance, the multifaceted selection process was efficient in identifying applicants with suitable skills. Participation in the multifaceted selection procedure seems to be predictive of higher performance. Further research is needed to assess whether our results are generalisable to other medical schools.},

If on the other hand the agent gives in to temptation and orders the steak, her utility is given by u(s), and again we see that u(f) gt u(s) so she would prefer to commit to the smaller menu., author = Bryan, G and Karlan, D and Nelson, S, journal = Annu.

The reason, that reservation values were unobtainable, may no longer be true now that massive datasets tracking detailed individual behavior exist. Hence, a fundamental change in the way goods are priced may be underway. I investigate this claim in one context. I show demographics, which in the past could be used to personalize prices, poorly predict which consumers subscribe to Netflix. By contrast, modern web- browsing data, with variables such as visits to Amazon.com and internet use on Tuesdays - variables which reflect behavior - do substantially better. I then present a model to estimate demand and simulate outcomes had 1st degree PD been implemented. The model is structural, derived from canonical theory models, but resembles an ordered Probit, allowing a new method for handling massive datasets and addressing overfitting and high dimensionality. Simulations show using demographics alone to tailor prices raises profits by 0.8\%. Including nearly 5000 potential website browsing explanatory variables increases profits by much more, 12.2\%, increasingly the appeal of tailored pricing, and resulting in some consumers paying double the price others do for the exact same product. Implications for the overall economy and its structure are discussed. (JEL: D42, L130)},

  abstract = {I analyze a general setting where a policy maker needs information that financial market traders have in order to implement her optimal policy, and market prices can potentially reveal this information. Policy decisions, in turn, affect asset values, hence forward looking traders may have incentives to withhold information. I derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of fully revealing equilibria in competitive financial markets, which identifies all situations where learning from prices for policy purposes works, and where it does not. Full revelation may be impossible because the pricing problem is a self-defeating prophecy. Using the result, I demonstrate that some corporate prediction markets are ill-designed and punish traders for revealing their information, and show how to fix it. I also discuss the possibility of using market information for banking supervision and central banking, and the general problem of asset design.},

  abstract = {Consumer choice is often influenced by the context, defined by the set of alternatives under consideration. Two hypotheses about the effect of context on choice are proposed. The first hypothesis, tradeoff contrast, states that the tendency to prefer an alternative is enhanced or hindered depending on whether the tradeoffs within the set under consideration are favorable or unfavorable to that option. The second hypothesis, extremeness aversion, states that the attractiveness of an option is enhanced if it is an intermediate option in the choice set and is diminished if it is an extreme option. These hypotheses can explain previous findings (e.g., attraction and compromise effects) and predict some new effects, demonstrated in a series of studies with consumer products as choice alternatives. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence
of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost
to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect
reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop
an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties.
Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via
prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity)
is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives
necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models
of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the
theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists.
Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists
respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified
a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists
act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not
when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists
tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives
are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result
from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study
Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation
of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate
at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others'
prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational
incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly
reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with
our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives,
egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others'
public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus

  abstract = {Abstract: A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties. Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity) is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists. Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others' prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives, egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others' public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of altruism and indirect reciprocity},

Analysing a unique dataset of donations to online fundraising pages, we find positive and sizeable peer effects: a £10 increase in the mean of past donations increases giving by £2.50, on average. Donations respond to both very large and very small amounts and to changes in the mode. We find little evidence that donations signal charity quality – our preferred explanation is that donors use information on earlier donations to decide what is appropriate for them to give.

The effect is about half as large as suggested by ordinary least squares. Thus, we present evidence that beliefs have a causal effect on contributions, but also that beliefs are endogenous.We compare the causal, belief-based model of contributions to alternative models based on matching the previous contributions of others and responding to one's deviation from the aver- age in the previous round. The causal, belief-based model performs well, indicating that beliefs have a central role in determining contributions.},

Analysing a unique dataset of donations to online fundraising pages, we find positive and sizeable peer effects: a \textbackslash{}pounds10 increase in the mean of past donations increases giving by \textbackslash{}pounds2.50, on average. Donations respond to both very large and very small amounts and to changes in the mode. We find little evidence that donations signal charity quality – our preferred explanation is that donors use information on earlier donations to decide what is appropriate for them to give.

A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised.

  abstract = {We randomize advertising content motivated by the psychology literature on sympathy generation and framing effects in mailings to about 185,000 prospective new donors in India. We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.},

Until the late 1980s, coffee growers and producing states retained

that was available. This was due in part to the collective actions
of coffee-producing states, which led to the imposition of a regulatory
regime involving export quotas, creating rents for the producing
countries. By the late 1980s, coffee TNCs had consolidated their
control over core markets, and began to use their market power to
increase their shares of both income and surplus. This shift was
greatly accelerated by the breakdown of the export quota regime in
1989. The article concludes that these results necessitate a reformulation

  abstract = {As firms switch from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans, employees bear more responsibility for making decisions about how much to save. The employees who fail to join the plan or who participate at a very low level appear to be saving at less than the predicted life cycle savings rates. Behavioral explanations for this behavior stress bounded rationality and self-control and suggest that at least some of the low-saving households are making a mistake and would welcome aid in making decisions about their saving. In this paper, we propose such a prescriptive savings program, called Save More Tomorrow? (hereafter, the SMarT program). The essence of the program is straightforward: people commit in advance to allocating a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings. We report evidence on the first three implementations of the SMarT program. Our key findings, from the first implementation, which has been in place for four annual raises, are as follows: (1) a high proportion (78 percent) of those offered the plan joined, (2) the vast majority of those enrolled in the SMarT plan (80 percent) remained in it through the fourth pay raise, and (3) the average saving rates for SMarT program participants increased from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months. The results suggest that behavioral economics can be used to design effective prescriptive programs for important economic decisions.},

  abstract = {We consider a setting in which we have a treatment and a large number of covariates for a set of observations, and wish to model their relationship with an outcome of interest. We propose a simple method for modeling interactions between the treatment and covariates. The idea is to modify the covariate in a simple way, and then fit a standard model using the modified covariates and no main effects. We show that coupled with an efficiency augmentation procedure, this method produces valid inferences in a variety of settings. It can be useful for personalized medicine: determining from a large set of biomarkers the subset of patients that can potentially benefit from a treatment. We apply the method to both simulated datasets and gene expression studies of cancer. The modified data can be used for other purposes, for example large scale hypothesis testing for determining which of a set of covariates interact with a treatment variable.},

This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5–6):1011–1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.}

The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of these two groups in the clinical phase. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A prospective cohort study was performed to compare the performance of 389 medical students admitted by selection with that of 938 students admitted by weighted lottery between 2001 and 2004. Follow-up of these cohorts lasted 5.5-8.5\hspace{1em}years. The main outcome measures were the mean grade obtained on the first five discipline-specific clerkships by all cohorts and the mean grade achieved on all 10 clerkships by the cohorts of 2001 and 2002. Results\hspace{0.6em} Selected students obtained a significantly higher mean grade during their first five clerkships than lottery-admitted students (mean\hspace{1em}±\hspace{1em}standard error [SE] 7.95\hspace{1em}±\hspace{1em}0.03, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.90-8.00 versus mean\hspace{1em}±\hspace{1em}SE 7.84\hspace{1em}±\hspace{1em}0.02, 95\% CI 7.81-7.87; p\hspace{1em}\hspace{1em}0.001). This difference reflected the fact that selected students achieved a grade of ≥\hspace{1em}8.0 1.5 times more often than lottery-admitted students. An analysis of all mean grades awarded on 10 clerkships revealed the same results. Moreover, the longer follow-up period over the clerkships showed that the relative risk for dropout was twice as low in the selected student group as in the lottery-admitted student group. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The selected group received significantly higher mean grades on their first five clerkships, which could not be attributed to factors other than the selection procedure. Although the risk for dropout before the clinical phase increased somewhat in both groups, the actual dropout rate proved to be twice as low in the selected group.},

The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization.

Despite marked differences in expected pension replacement rates - where the Dutch replacement rates are systematically higher than the American rates - the perceived savings adequacy is more or less the same across Dutch and American workers. In both countries, about half of the respondents were confident they had amassed sufficient retirement savings. Individuals' perceived savings adequacy was found to be influenced by three groups of factors : trust in pension institutions (pension funds, banks, insurance companies and governments), social forces and psychological dispositions. This study shows that differences in the dispositions of workers (with respect to future orientation and financial planning) played a far larger role in explaining differences in perceptions of savings adequacy in the United States than in The Netherlands.

The control treatment is a standard public bad experiment, while in the leader treatments the design is such that in each group the leader decides first on his or her investment in the public bad.

In the same-leader-costs treatment, all subjects are confronted with the same costs, while in the no-leader-costs treatment the leader faces no direct costs of acting socially. It is found that followers invest significantly less in the public bad when there is a leader compared with a situation when there is no leader. Comparing the two treatments, we find, moreover, that the leadership effect is somewhat stronger when leaders face the same costs as followers compared with the situation in which leaders bear no costs. Randomly chosen leaders set an example by investing less than average players in a standard public bad game, and leader investments are lowest when the costs of leading are low.}

First, it is possible that the projects that are selected for evaluation respond differently to treatment. If this is the case, the results of these evaluations will poorly predict the performance of future programs. Further, while Hawthorne effects could occur within a study, project implementers could also act differently when their project is being evaluated. In this case, the effect of the program would be confounded with the effect of the impact evaluation. Retrospective studies could also facilitate specification searching and be particularly selected. While others have considered these issues in individual cases, it has been difficult to gauge to what extent the problems are systemic. I use World Bank data on projects that did and did not receive impact evaluations and find a large gap in performance ratings between the projects that received impact evaluations and those that did not.

This institutional reform is here used to estimate the causal effect of one year of university education on wages. I find that the fifth year of university education increased wages by 7\%–9\%. This differential is found by comparing wages of cohorts of graduates enrolling five years before and five years after the reform in a difference-in-differences approach.},

This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.},

This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail.

We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (Nhouseholds=1246; Norganizations=64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science:
How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to
behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals
rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an
explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action
can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the
availability of increased status for those who contribute to public
goods.

In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to
collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group
members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and
(c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well
as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions
are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute
(as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of
obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth
study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions,
indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.}

  abstract = {Collective Action and Status My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science: How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the availability of increased status for those who contribute to public goods. In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and (c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute (as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions, indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.}

We report results from a field experiment in which a non-profit firm asked their current volunteers to donate money, in a randomly-staggered roll-out. We observe volunteers' entire portfolio of giving to the firm – both donations, and volunteer hours before and after the call. Overall, these results suggested there was some decline in volunteer hours among volunteers who were newer to the firm. By contrast, long-time volunteers maintained their volunteering after the call, and were also more likely to donate in the first place. Substitution was rare, as the donors themselves did not decrease their volunteer hours after donating. Our findings provide new evidence for how personal history can shape charitable giving decisions, and provide new practical guidance for fundraisers.}

It is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader. And now it has been completely rewritten and updated.You are told about the various levels of reading and how to achieve them – from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading, you learn how to pigeonhole a book, X-ray it, extract the author's message, criticize. You are taught the different reading techniques for reading practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science.Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests whereby you can measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension and speed.},

Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous.

The widely advertised "Give Five" campaign was aimed to encourage people to give five percent of their income and volunteer five hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the "Give Five", I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected.

This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using a newly available individual-level panel data. Understanding these spillover effects may be quite important, given the existing literature that links religiosity to several economically important social behaviors. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. Increasing the price of religious giving decreases not only religious contributions but also religious attendance. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is -0.27. Furthermore, a 1\% increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4\% increase in religious attendance.

Since Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity¬°¬Øs star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third party ratings in not-for-profit markets.},

  abstract = {The true purpose of bitcoin could be to reboot the internet. Right now the cryptocurrency and its cousins, like ethereum, are the province of wild speculation and vast, sudden accumulations of wealth. But as Steven Johnson writes for the New York Times, the underlying blockchain technology could become the new foundation of a secure, decentralized computer network—one where closed services from Facebook, Google, and Amazon exist in a radically different, more accountable form. Or, if those companies miss the boat, perhaps they won’t exist at all.},
  annotation = {You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction — say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum — that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of “blocks” of data, that record is called the blockchain.\\
The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening — something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I’ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.\\
the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries.},

  abstract = {Dark pools are equity trading systems that do not publicly display orders. Dark pools offer potential price improvements but do not guarantee execution. Informed traders tend to trade in the same direction, crowd on the heavy side of the market, and face a higher execution risk in the dark pool, relative to uninformed traders. Consequently, exchanges are more attractive to informed traders, and dark pools are more attractive to uninformed traders. Under certain conditions, adding a dark pool alongside an exchange concentrates price-relevant information into the exchange and improves price discovery. Improved price discovery coincides with reduced exchange liquidity.},
