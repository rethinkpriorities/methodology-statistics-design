# **Introduction and overview**

## Rethink Priorities: Our approach to empirical and quantitative work

## The purpose of this resource

<!-- (integrate discussion from Slack thread and readme) -->

A github-hosted 'bookdown' for structured in-depth discussion

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

*David Reinstein's conception:*

- Don't share any confidential data or sensitive information

- Don't feel compelled to flesh out all sections with original content. Don’t add content just because "it’s in a typical syllabus’.

- Focus on things that we use, have used, want to use, or have been requested to address.
     - Secondarily, on things relevant to Effective Altruism-related research in general
- Do curate link, and embed resources from elsewhere

- Incorporate examples from our work (where these are not sensitive or they where can be made anonymous)


- Do put in content that is more in-depth and technical, or involving R-code and tools
    - Still, do try to 'offset' details (in folding blocks, appendix sections, margin notes), where it would otherwise clutter the book
- Start with 'plain language' explanations of technical content; for ourselves, and potentially to share with partners in future


I also hope to use this to develop 'templates and standard practices' for our work.

**What to include and when to dive into the rabbit hole?** (Unfold: the 'second time it comes up' rule)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

In ‘building a knowledge base’, there are some things that are important to include, but others should be excluded.  If we are compulsive and auto-nerd-sniped to go down every rabbit hole it will be wasteful. But some rabbit holes will be worth going down, at least partially.

*What’s a good rule-of-thumb for knowing if it’s worth a dive?* Maybe the 'second time rule'?

Mark the issue the first time it comes up, perhaps leave a placeholder and a link to the original notes or discussion.

Then the second time an issue comes up it may be safe to assume its an ‘important issue to dive into and document’?

```


Below, 'a partial dive into the rabbit hole', for one possible framework.

```{block2,  type='note'}


What do I mean by a 'partial dive into the rabbit hole?'

- Explain how it applied to our problem (generically if there is a confidentiality issue)

- Curated links [PeteW-gists](https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/)-eqsue,

- characterize in our own words (but concisely)

- give a code example in a 'vignette',

- check our understanding through communication and discussion with others, flag key issues

```



## Sections and organization {#outline_sections}
(Proposed/discussed below -- keep updated with actual structure)

**[DATA, CODE](#data)** \*

<div class="marginnote">

\* Note that the capital letters denote the highest-level sections, but in the markdown these are at the same level as the sections below
</div>

**Coding practice and tools**

(Languages, clean code, reproducability, etc.)

**Data practices**

(Storing, labeling, etc)

**[PRESENTING AND DESCRIBING DATA](#present)**

- Methods of 'describing data'

- Formatting: tables, figures, and numerical content**

- Visualizations: suggested/preferred formats and templates


**SURVEY DESIGNS AND METHODS**

- How to ask good survey questions

- Avoiding pitfalls

- Sampling issues and representativeness

- Constructing reliable indices and scales

- Implementation platforms and issues

- Survey design tools (IT)

**EXPERIMENTS AND TRIALS*

- [Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines](#expt-qual-imp)

- [Experiment and trial design: quantitative issues](#expt-quant)

- 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)
- Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs
- Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design
- Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')


**BASIC STATISTICS: MODELING, TESTING AND INFERENCE**

- Bayesian, frequentist, and other approaches

- A 'statistical model'\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* I put in the first discussion of 'models' here because, at least in one perspective, all of the below is based on models.
</div>

- Bayesian updating and inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Preferred approaches ('which tests') etc.

**[MODELING, PREDICTION, INFERENCE, AND MACHINE LEARNING](#modeling)**

- "Multi-variable 'regression' models" and specification choices
- Interpreting model results
- Predictive modeling and machine learning
- Practical Bayesian approaches and interpretations
- Psychometrics, especially factor analysis

**[CAUSAL INFERENCE](#causal)**

- Basic ideas and frameworks (simple, potential outcomes, DAGs)
- Pitfalls and mistakes (layman's terms)
- The experimental ideal
- Non-experimental approaches to causal inference
- Dealing with attrition

**[MONTE-CARLO 'FERMI ESTIMATION' APPROACHES](#fermi);**

- The basic ideas
- Causal and Guesstimate
- Code-based tools

## Style and 'collophon'

For more information on how this 'bookdown' was created, see our public template [here](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/bookdown-template/), and also consult the resources at [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/)

## R setup and packages

We are using `Renv` to keep packages aligned. Please install Renv it and snapshot 

`renv::dependencies` should tell us what packages are used/needed

```{r}
dependencies <- renv::dependencies()
dependencies[2] %>% unique() %>% as.list()

```
